I stayed at ‚Äûthe orchid‚Äú hotel in Mumbai and went for dinner to the roof top restaurant. It was Halloween night and a special setting. The view is spectacular. I had a great mocktail and a really delicious Indian vegetarian main course. But what I can mostly recommend is dessert. Try the home made ice cream. So yummy. But the best of all is the very nice and helpful waiters. Especially Tushar. He is so funny and nice. I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely eat here again. ,"Had a spooky evening at Mostly Grills Today. The guy at the entrance gave me goosebumps. It was indeed an epic Halloween ambience with superb decor. The food was great. The service was exceptionally high on standards. The staff is courteous and well trained. Special thanks to Manager Anush, Samuel, Tushar Parth for making my evening a memorable one. Thank you Team Mostly Grills","good services and mankind.

Thank you for wrapping up my beautiful visit here on a high note!",Great place... Superb ambiance. Service is excellent. Refreshing aroma as you enter the hotel. The staff is presentable and politely special mention to Priyanka and Anush.Enjoyed the food. Perfectly crafted by chef. Will visit again and again.,October fest was going on when i went. Drinks were really expensive for a empty bar. The bar was completely empty and the ambience is a disaster.,"Unfortunately I was having dinner at night time so I could not enjoy the views, only the distant noise and airport lights.
Varied menu and friendly staff.",I stayed at ‚Äûthe orchid‚Äú hotel in Mumbai and went for dinner to the roof top restaurant. It was Halloween night and a special setting. The view is spectacular.
