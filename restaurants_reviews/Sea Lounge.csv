"Located on 1st floor. Overlooking Arabian sea. A/c & Non A/C Comfortable sitting. Good attentive service. Good food with limited menu. It is for breakfast, high tea & sundown service for Residents. Another place to relax & read.","Sea Lounge specializes in light meals so its not for those looking to eat full course meals. It offers a variety of Indian street food and international snacks. We tried their bombay mix toastie, chilly cheese toast and penne pasta along with cold coffee and a berry n apple smoothie. The food was delicious and not to heavy on the pocket as well. The service was efficient and homely. We ended the meal with a gooey chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. We had a lovely meal. The place doesnt have reserved seating so its first come first service. I would recommend taking a window table to get beautiful views of the Gateway of India and the harbour. ",The full Maharaja high tea was a feast of fabulous hot and cold savouries and then a myriad of sweets. There was no space to put all the plates and trays of food brought hut it was a lovely experience. The Indian foods were best (we can get the ham sandwiches at home so focused on the local foods).,"One of the great icons of India, the setting and hotel are beautiful, the expectation great, but high tea was a let down. The food was average at best, the service not to be compared with other similar establishments in Mumbai, or across the world. Poor value for money poor at RS3,900 (inc GST) for 2. That said, if you come to Mumbai seeing the sunset here is a must. Just don't expect too much.",Was not a great experience other than the ambience. The snacks they brought us were quite bland and overpriced and they ran out of Kingfisher Ultra (which was also dearer than at our own hotel) and had to get from another bar within the hotel! For a facility within the famous Taj hotel the whole thing lacked a certain spark and felt that we were paying for the privilege.,"Wow what a place to go for breakfast.
Lots of variety of both European and Indian food
The wait staff were only too happy to describe the Indian food and advise of the ingredients.
Would love to go again however it is fairly expensive","We visited Sea Lounge after 30 years. Disappointing to experience poor quality of food served for High tea.The seats were nicely located facing Gateway of India & staff was courteous.The bhels & sandwiches , which are the signature dishes were less than average. you get better quality on streets.Salmon served along bread would have tasted better if roasted.Pav bhaji was good.The most disappointing was tea preparations . They were not brewed properly and ordinary tea leaves were used. The masala tea was disaster.","Beautiful setting, white tablecloths, fine china, and professional, attentive service, this dining room is truly elegant for breakfast. Individually prepared eggs, dosas, waffles, or selections from their extensive buffet are all top notch and delicious.","I have lived near the Taj in the early 1950's......many hotels may come and go but to me it was, is , and always will be THE PLACE. We just went to the Sea Lounge for high tea. It was an outstanding experience. We usually have some amazing teas in London., but this is head and shoulders above them all. Apart from scrumptious stuff offered by all teas, the Taj had an extensive supply of very tasty Indian snacks as well. We feasted for nearly three hours. It was an absolute pleasure. The sea Lounge, and the Taj looked as grand as ever.","The Sea Lounge in The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is indeed a rich experience with their attention to detail, picturesque view of the Arabian sea and the Gateway of India. The place is designed to beauty, class and elegance. Very polite people and amazing food and coffee.","Located on 1st floor. Overlooking Arabian sea. A/c & Non A/C Comfortable sitting.
