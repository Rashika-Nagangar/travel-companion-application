"So I was here on a Saturday night, for a special occasion and I must say this was the right choice we made when it came to Italian cuisine. From the moment we entered, to dining and leaving the restaurant, we were taken well care of.Our server Alrina, greeted & served us with warmth despite the customizations we made to the menu. But the best we tried was the Lamb carpaccio, Lasagne, Panna cotta and Pepperoni pizza. Would love to be back here.","I was there after long day of travelling. Service was very good. As if they waited just for me. Took an amazing Borata, and the lamb with Rissoto. The lamb dish was nice. I was expecting the lamb to be more tender as it says Osobuco style. But still it was tasety. The Tiramisu was great! I will come back there. ","Great food, great service, everything outstanding. Special thanks to chef Roberto!!! Great evening!!!","We visited Romano's for my best friend's birthday and Oh boy! what an experience...The restaurant is situated on the ground floor in JW Marriott near Mumbai's T2 Airport and serves Italian cuisines. As soon as you walk in you notice an amazing ambiance, open kitchen and a huge shelf of unimaginable types of wines. The place is nicely lit to give you a warm and welcoming feeling.We were escorted to our table by our cute little staff who helped us throughout. The staff is extremely good and also suggests for dish we should try out. We called for variety of food like Burrata, Chicken Tomato Soup, King Prawns, Fried Calamari, Pizza, Pasta, Lamb and Steamed Fish...all of it tantalized our taste buds and made us wanting for more.. Apparently the lamb that was served was from NZ and the fish was from Chile - They both were indeed very tasty and succulent.Out an out a must visit place when in Mumbai for fine dining and an experience that won't fade away quickly.Kudos to the team at Romano's!","Food was tasty. Spread was good too. Options for breakfast was very good. I felt it was little expensive however, food was very tasty.","I live in NYC metro area so I have access to outstanding Italian restaurants. This has been my second visit to Mumbai and have been totally surprised that you could find such an outstanding Italian restaurant that compares to any in NYC in India. Service- Outstanding- Ashuli and her team provide a very Friendly and knowledgeable staff. The go out of their way to ensure everything is perfectChef- Roberto comes out and makes makes recommendations and follow's up on your your dinner.Food- I have had dined there over 5 times in the couple of weeks i was there and everyone one has been excellent. The Burrata -amazing, Pizza- excellent. I will be traveling to Mumbai every few months and this will be on my must list for dining.","I recently stayed at JW Marriott Sahar and I tried Romano's. It was excellent and truly authentic Italian (and I'm originally from Italy)! The whole dinner was scrumptious with Carbonara at the top of the chart! It was one of the best carbonara I've ever had!5 stars, no doubt, for ambiance, decor, service and I wish I could give more stars to Chef Roberto Zorzoli.","Your one stop shop for the finest Italian fare in the city and possibly even the country. Rustic, authentic and plush come together in an ambient surrounding. Great food, outstanding service and truly a memorable experience. What’s best is the restaurant manager Ms. Ashuli who walks you through your meal and ensures you’re always having a good time! Would definitely recommend. ","Been here for a business meet. Such a beautifully set place. Just the right ambience for a business meet, maybe a date or a family gathering. Tried various dishes and I must say that Chef Kalpesh, Chef Zela, Chef Sidhesh were are their best, and Chef Roberto is soo friendly with everyone that it feels comfortable.Coming to the service at Romano's.. It's the best I have ever got till now.. Mr. Melroy and Ms. Ashuli are the best managers I have met till date.. And Mr.Partha with his team Pratik,Alrina,Baby,Avlon,Vishnu,Dhaval,Sandesh and Kim.... All these guyzzz are really really amazing... They are soo prompt at their service makes one feel really relaxed and happy as well!! Wil surely visit this place again.Kudos to all these guyz to make the business meet into a wonderful dine out!!","The staff at Romano's is extremely courteous. It was my mothers birthday last week and I had decided to surprise her by taking her for dinner to Romano's. The Restaurant Assistant Manager, Mr. Partha made sure everything was set and made perfect for her. My mother was asked to choose a table for herself, Miss Baby walked us to our table and was sweet enough to appreciate my mother for her selection. Miss Alrina Dsouza was the associate that helped my mother be at ease and helped her with her choice of food and beverage. Miss Kim made sure that our table was crumble free and that we had a clean set of plates and cutlery after every course. Mr. Partha made sure to come and check on us at frequent intervals and made sure that we were comfortable and that we had a great time. Romano's is the place to be at when one wishes to be treated royally. They'll make sure that the guests have nothing to complain about. They'll do more than what's asked of them to make sure the guest leaves the restaurant with a smile on his/her face. And not to mention, they were damn sweet to get us a complimentary pizza. Love and Best wishes to the entire team. Thank you for making this birthday a special one. P.S My mother loved the Berry Ice tea, Polpette and the salmon steak. The tiramisu at Romano's is to die for . I'd recommend Romano's to anyone and everyone. It is THE place to be at when you want to pamper yourself with some delicious food and beverages.","So I was here on a Saturday night, for a special occasion and I must say this was the right choice we made when it came to Italian cuisine.
