"I arrived quite late and the hotel staff helped me secure dinner (despite the kitchen closing in less than 5 minutes). In particular, Subhankar was a great waiter. He made excellent recommendations given I had to order quickly and kept me company without ever imposing. Only in India and at the St Regis could I receive such thoughtful and caring service. Highly recommend the “By the Mekong Chicken” — wonderful rich dish with moderate spice.Highly-recommend for business and romantic dinners. Great views of the south of Mumbai.","Went back to By The Mekong after quite a while....It’s got an amazing view and the food is to die for We had the edamame dim sim & veg crystal dumpling for starters, both were very good. For mains the noodles & mix vegetables were exotic, The green Thai curry was mellow and gelled very well with the noodlesThe hazelnuts cherry pastry was too goodArnold took very care of us and Siddhi, Uday & Nemish were very prompt in serving us smilingly...Would highly recommend this place and would definitely go back....",It's always best place to visit again and again. Food is amazing with excellent staff. The best Asian restaurant in Mumbai. The ambience is also good.,"I visited Mumbai to meet my best friend and he suggested that we go for Asian cuisine. I am honestly not a fan, but was convinced has he spoke highly of the place and the food. I would have really regretted if had turned him down. The restaurant is beautiful! It is located on the 37th floor and sea view is just mesmerising. The food too was a delight. We went for spinach wrapped chicken and Edamame truffle dumplings to begin with. The bbq'd black pepper and kaffir lamb chops were to die for! And lastly we went for flaming mud cake - speechless about this one.All in all, I highly recommend this place as the food, ambience & service are all beyond the mark. I am glad my friend took me here.",Visited by the Mekong today and it was an amazing experience. Nice food with perfect ambience and staff...,"Most amazing dinner and dinner ever!!!
Sharique is the best waiter/man of India ever!
Come to St Regis hotel and By the Mekong for the best time and top it off with Club Luna!!!","Staying in my favourite Mumbai business hotel I have finally been able to try By The Mekong.This is an excellent place to try if you want absolutely first class Asian from a wide ranging menu in central Mumbai.With excellent views, plenty of room between tables for those intimate dinners or business conversations, superb service and some of the best Asian food I have tried anywhere in the world this location is unmissable.A great wine list compliments the offering.I did mention to the manager that I am still a little surprised in travels in Mumbai restaurants that with the extraordinary quality now of first class locations such as this that they still insist on serving automatic machine coffee. It must only be a matter of time before the trend in the rest of the world to cap off a great meal with barista quality caffeine arrives in India's financial capital also !Still, this wonderful establishment is highly recommended","Awesome food!!!Loved Every bit! Dimsums a must try
Special thanks to chef Mahesh Kadam for recommendation
