"We had great experience with awesome service from Mr.Asif Shaikh, Shweta and Rishikesh. The food was delicious especially salads, starters and desserts.
We would like to come again..☺☺",Their staff was amazing. Diana guided us well and Akshada served us a very good chat and pasta. Good experience at Momo Cafe.,"Stopped for Buffet Lunch on the way to the airport. They have a Papri Chaat, Golgappas, Sev Puri counters which provide decent taste but I have had better tasting stuff by the roadside. They have extensive selection of salads and cheese which I could not try since we went at 2.30 p.m. and were informed at 2.45 that they would close at 3.00 which was a surprise to us. Someone should have told us in advance when we sat down to eat - or they expect guests to enter a ""who eats fastest contest"" and finish the buffet in 30 minutes. They also have soups and starters and main course and desserts. Pressed for time I only had time for Pasta in Arrabiata sauce which was excellent and in fact the highlight of the buffet. For main course being a vegetarian I had Paneer Khurchan - avoidable, Bhindi ka Salan - essentially pieces of Bhindi in Salan which didnt taste like Salan (salan is supposed to be spicy but insipid taste here), Aloo (excellent cooked south indian way), Pachranga Dal - not upto the mark - Overall a 2 star rating for main course. Desserts were good and the Rose flavoured Kulfi could have been excellent but for the fact that it was too sweet.However the service was very good and the service staff was constantly monitoring our needs and fetching us whatever we required. Since the place is in the looby , it is quite noisy and if you are looking for a quite place to have food, best avoided","Went with copple of friends,, the momo cafe is one of the best restaurant for buffet near to the Mumbai Airport, food was delicious and manager Rupesh was outstanding in his work and handling customers!! Thanx team and continue what u r doing. Best wishes!! ",One of the most miserably managed restaurant in such a good property. Service was so poor and lethargic that we decided not visit this place for any further meetings.Very sad that such good property is managed by bad team.,"Momo Cafe at the Courtyard Marriott is a lovely place to have a peaceful, relaxing meal with your friends or family members. The place is very spacious and comfortable. Service is warm and efficient. Food quality, taste and variety is awesome. Specially loved the chaat counter, desserts and salads.Overall superb and memorable experience !!! ",One of my favourite cafe near International Airport .... Momo cafe is descent and nice to hangon and relax for sometime with a cup of tea or coffee...,"I love the buffet wide range of dishes and staff was excellent especially mr.
