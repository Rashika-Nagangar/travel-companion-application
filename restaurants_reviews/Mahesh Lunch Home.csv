"An small unassuming restaurant with a fantastic endless menu.The Bombay duck was very good, so good I had a second portion. The fish melted in you mouth and the light tempura style batter was just perfect.I followed this with there traditional fish curry with locally caught fish, a thick flavoursome sauce compliment but not over powered the fish. Next I had garlic chilli chicken, amazing flavours and plenty of chicken all washed down with a home made mango lasi.I will defiantly be having lunch here my flight tomorrow.","This restaurant is both in the lonely planet and was recommended by our hotel as it was a 1 min walk away. All in all the food was great. The only down side is probably that everyone was being guided to eat the same dishes, something we experienced in more than one resstaurant in India! As long as you're happy to eat the fish tikka to start and the crab with or without shell for main you will enjoy this experience!! ",Satiate your desire for sea food here.extremely popular among sea food lovers in the city.do try their tandoori crab and masala pomfret.a big yes from my side,"We visited this restaurant on recommendation from our hotel and was not disappointed, the curries, rice and breads were all outstanding and the service was superb.",This place was excellent for seafood near Taj hotel in mumbai. 10 min drive from Taj. Our whole family enjoyed the food here. Staff was very attentive and provided great service,"Tried lobster, shrimp and pomfret some in Mangalorean style some in light continental sauces. They serve great South Indian Appams too. The pomfrets were really big . You can order the size you want. Attentive waiters to add. The damage INR 9500 for 4 people. Only one had beer. Too expensive for a way side run of the mill ambience. Nothing exceptional about the interiors.",I visited with my partner who was living in Mumbai at the time.We had koliwada fried prawns to start and crab ghee roast for main course. The crab ghee roast was amazing. Very buttery and spicy (I don't have the greatest spice tolerance and I very much enjoyed this) They bring the crab out to show you before you confirm. Highly recommended checking this place out if you like sea food.Pricing- affordable to expensive bracket depending on what you choose. For two of us the crab was about £20. ,"In Mumbai fort area if you look for sea food and other non veg dishes, Mahesh Lunch home is theeee..e best place to enjoy. Top class services and hospitality one gets there. Food served is hygienic and mouth watering.The place is just as you expect,quite clean, and the staff there create the perfect family environment for you.I wish visiting it again and again.","While on business trips, I had savoured the culinary fare at their Juhu outlet twice in the past and returned every time asking for more. On a recent weekend sojourn in Mumbai, I wanted to share the gastronomic delight at iconic Mahesh Lunch Home with my dear wife. Thus on a rain-soaked Saturday, we walked into the restaurant on Cawasji Patel Street in Fort for lunch. We were immediately ushered into a table for four at the ground floor section as the crowd was thin at that time of the day. Considering it as an old outlet (since 1977), the refurbished interiors were simple and functional.We ordered a bottle of Kingfisher and glass of ginger-lemon soda to go with a portion of Bombay Duck fry…the famous Bombay Duck or Bombils as known in the local parlance. Lightly battered, rava (semolina) coated and crisply fried bombils were served on a plate… the fishes with soft flesh and very fine bones were the freshest and tasted simply superb, undoubtedly the best I have had so far! In the main course, we asked for Appam (Kerala style fermented rice pancake), Neer Dosa and a plate of steamed rice with a portion each of Clams Sukha (slightly curried clams) and Crab Curry. The clam preparation was spicy but not pungent at all and we enjoyed every bit of it leaving behind a pile of shells! The crab curry made of a full midsized crab with mildly spicy gravy went very well with rice but the quantity was too much for us to do justice – we had to pack home much of it for the next day’s lunch. And the entire experience in gluttony at Mahesh cost us only Rs.1625/-…what an aftertaste!!! The wait staff was too polite, friendly and truly helpful assisting us to choose our food, guiding us to use right sauce etc. Such a courteous service endeared Mahesh more to us and enhanced our happiness. The eatery has come a long way in carving out a niche in satiating the denizens of Mumbai with coastal cuisine and firmly etched its claim to fame.","This restaurant has amazing food standard and taste .
