Had a great time. Had a amazing food and service. First time in prego and it was memorable. Server was really professional and very well knowledgeable. Will be back soon.,"The ambience is ace and the staff is courteous, my interaction was with Gourav at the bar. He was courteous and offered us with options based on our preferences. The experience was ruined by Keval Soni as he started hurling abuses at the staff In a staff meeting just round the corner. When we shared a glance instead of being apologetic of the behaviour he was rude with a retort. ",I decided to celebrate my Mothers birthday at Prego and i could not have got a better place to do so. Honestly i was never so keen about Italian food and it was only for my wife's love for Italian food that we ended up here. But my visit to Prego changed it all. I have never ever known Italian food to be this amazing.I had very bad opinions about minestrone soup but the one i had here was the best. The Aglio Olio peperoncino pasta and Risotto was mouth watering and as a matter of surprise my mother who never loved eating pasta had it to her hearts content.I thank Chef. Vishal Sawant for this sumptous feast of amazing Italian food who was also kind enough to attend our table personally and know our opinions regarding the food. Most of all i am thankful to him for a surprise cake he arranged for my mom. That was really sweet. I would also thank Ms. Mubba for offering her kind and polite service at our table. My mother was really pleased to have such an amazing and memorable birthday.All in all a must visit for all Italian food lovers. You will love it !!! ,"I did my best to find the best Italian restaurant in town to give a memorable experience to my one and only...Along came the MIL and the SIL, who have never had authentic italian culinary experience and have there fair share of Indian curries and are Masters in the Indian Kitchen. The Girls had a once in a life time experience and I hope I was able to give a lasting impression on the one who matters the most to me... The food was Authentic...( check out the bill(pic) for the Items ordered)... Its a fine dinning place at the Westin garden city in Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharastra, India...So expect to get your moneys worth...not crowded... located in quaint area of the Property with a few giggles...Brought back many memories of my one off ten day trip to Italy in 2011...I definitely recommend it ...","It was our first experience at Prego and indeed memorable. Ambiance was serene, food was authentic and hospitality was at its best. Special thanks to Chef Antonello for his personal care and recommendations.
Buch",Vinit is Master of his craft. I highly recommend that you give him just a few ideas of what you like and he will delight your every taste. He made me some of the best martinis I have ever had!! I shall now call him Vinit the Martini Master!!! If you are in Mumbai and don’t stop in you are missing out! ,"First evening we went here (5 persons), it went completely wrong. Ordering took forever. Not all dishes arrived at our table at the same moment. For one person it took even almost 45 minutes (!) hour before she got her order. First it seemed they had 'lost' her order, some time later it became, clear they then forgot to forward it to the kitchen. Only when someone from us escalated to managament, the order came through. The rest of us already finished their diner long time, of course.Nevertheless, I went back to this restaurant later that week. Once on my own, one time with 4 persons. On both occasions everything went smoothly. The food itself is not okay.","We were at Prego for my sons birthday and since he is an Italian food fan we opted for Prego. We didn't go there with any great expectations but boy, were we wrong!! The food is authentic Italian which is the best ingredients combined with masterful combinations and the best cooking techniques. We loved every dish we ordered but would like to mention the some we loved the most the Carpatio Manzo , Prosciutto and the crab Taglioli. Our family is typically non-veg biased but even the Asparagi soup is to die for. Chef Anto is a master of his craft and a special mention to Mona, who ensured that we had the best time with prompt and interactive service and some good recommendations. This is pure Italian cuisine so don't expect any fusion and they also have a great veg selection. Its surprisingly Value for money considering the ambiance and cuisine quality and we had the Yes Bank offer too, that was a sweetner. This definitely warrants a second visit, hopefully shortly!! Oh did I mention that Chef Anto sings !!","Awesome stuff Naresh is really helpful and makes sure that guests are always happy
Naresh made sure that our order got to us on time even when there was a lot of crowd
Cheers
I will see you at prego again","I visit prego frequently when meeting friends as it's in the same building as my office. Super atmosphere, great food, amazing house bread! My favourite is the Chicken Pizza with a beer or Cold Coffee which ever one is in the mood for. A big thumbs up for Monisha for her super service and warm smile. Thank you! All in all one of the best places to chill out in Goregaon East.",Had a great time. Had a amazing food and service. First time in prego and it was memorable.
