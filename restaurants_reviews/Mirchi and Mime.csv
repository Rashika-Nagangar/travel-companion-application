Beautiful ambiance with a uniqueness to the service will leave you literally speechless...simpler menu but ultimate treat to the taste buds...worth paying a visit..,"Visited this place for the first time and just loved it; the ambience, the sufficient lighting, delicious food, it's presentation and above all the friendly and smiling people who served us. Really liked all the non vegetarian dishes that we had ordered Prawns seekh tandoor, kheema ghotala, white pepper chicken, quail tandoor. The vegetarian platter could be improved. Especially the kothimbir vadi (this was a totally different version from anything that I've had before). The dessert sugar-free sitaphal pannacotta was simply out of this world (photo attached). All in all a great place to chill with family and friends.","Took one of my Mumbai teams for lunch on the 27th of Oct, 2017. This restaurant and it's sister (Madeira & Mime) take social responsibility to the next level by hiring waitstaff and cooks who are deaf / mute and you need to use (Indian) sign language to communicate. No worries - the menu has the signs you need to order food and drinks. Baljeet our head-waiter was fantastic and she served my group of 20+ ever complaining professionals with a smile and the food shut them up :). If you are brave - go for the chicken lollipops flavored with ghost pepper. Paneer Seekh is not to be missed and you will curse yourself if you never tasted the Prawn Curry or the Rajma Chawal (yes - you read that right). Lastly, it is sacrilege to leave without having the faluda ...Overall the food was excellent, service was very friendly and efficient and the social IQ of the owners to employ those who are usually discarded by the wayside of Indian society and integrate them into highend dining is just exquisite - and you can see the happiness written across the face of the service staff and the kitchen hands. This is not a sad place - and it makes you happy too.Get there *early* and you will NOT regret it.",We visited the restaurant on evening for dinner. We booked it in advance. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. The service and the food quality are both good. The price is reasonable.,"Sorry to say, but other than the thoughtfulness of hiring efficient staff, the food was average for the price. For a teetotaller, it could well be a miss..There are many more restaurants that serve better taste and ambience.Everything, like chicken dahi and angari chicken tasted sweetish..the onion, gobi brought to the table was neither pickled well nor had a dash of lime... serving size was just ok...service was super slow...suuuuppper slllowwww. Worst was sufiyani biryani..oh dat raw taste of mustard..and white raw chicken...worst biryani ever....my son vomitted...Roti were awesome...fresh and hot. Fish starters ok...expensive though. Staff sweet..","Everyone is welcomed with a smile here, amazing food, and great services. I would recommend must visit this place, vegetarian friendly üëçüèª",We loved our lunch here. Delicious food and a business with a purpose. Loved how the aid to teach the deaf if coupled with a great restaurant. This is a must visit place. Reservations recommended.,"I heard about this place quite a often. Finally been to mirchi and mime. And the experience was 5/ 5. Even 100 /100.Rajesh took care of our table very well and professionaly. Hats off man. I realy loved the way he serve with smile. And the manager who greeted us from outside, given a table is excellent at his work. The gentlemen who was inside the restaurant probably the manager is very good at his work. The spicy lollipops,, my god delicious but super super hot. But rajesh ne what exactly we wanted. So we got saved. The beautiful part is d god by. Everyone smiles n welcomes. What els you need. Just wowwwwwwwww.....See you soon hero.. Rajesh. Excellent job. ","Kudos to the owner for this amazing concept! We went there on busy weekend evening for dinner. We didn't have reservation but they have outdoor section for walk in guests. We went there early so could grab the seats without waiting. Service was bit sluggish given how busy the restaurant was. All the wait staff are verbally challenged but are very courteous. Coming to food, quantity of certain dishes especially starters is small. We had mocktails which also were overpriced. But main course was very very good. Overall fantastic food and good service. But it's a real shame that they don't give finger bowls instead they provide wet tissues. A restaurant of this stature in my opinion should not cut corners in such small things. But all in all I would strongly recommend this restaurant to experience the brilliant concept.","If you are in Mumbai don't miss this restaurant.
A different concept, with the traditional flavours of the Indian cuisine.
Perfect (deaf) service, good food, good wine.",Beautiful ambiance with a uniqueness to the service will leave you literally speechless...simpler menu but ultimate treat to the taste buds...worth paying a visit..,"Visited this place for the first time and just loved it; the ambience, the sufficient lighting, delicious food, it's presentation and above all the friendly and smiling people who served us.
