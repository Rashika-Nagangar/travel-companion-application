"Having read various reviews and had recommendations from both our hotel concierge and tour guide we were really looking forward to our meal. The restaurant seems to have two wings; we were shown right to the less refined area - but who cares as long as food is good. The staff were attentive and helpful. We found the menus extensive but quite dated in presentation - not what we’d expected from one on Mumbai’s feted eateries.However, the food - perhaps our choices and putting too much emphasis on the personal recommendations - failed to meet expectations. It was fine - my wife chose better then I with her Hyderbadi prawn main course. I chose a butter pepper and garlic prawn dish which was drowned in the taste of butter. The breads were v fresh and not too heavy - excellent.Overall fine, but we left a little underwhelmed.","If you are travelling to Mumbai, love seafood and have time for only one meal then it has to be at Trishna.
Recommendations by staff are good and the food is delicious.","Food was great , crab with butter garlic was a 9.5 / 10 for me .....the tandoori king prawns were a little over cooked , but the crab and butter garlic sauce compensated for that....a bit on the higher side ....",The king crab with garlic butter was the best we have ever tasted. The fried calamari was spicy and unusual. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The staff is attentive and helpful. This is a real treat.,I had a lunch here with my colleagues. They serve very good seafood in different forms! I would recommend you to take seafood items only here in this place. It doesn’t carry any meaning to have chicken in Trishna! Happy eating!,"Trishna ... the food is excellent and the service we have always got has been super. It's a great place for sea food lovers and recommendations are to have bombil fry crispy with some beer or white wine and butter garlic crabs. For veg the yellow dal is outstandingYes, it is expensive though to treat yourself from time to time it's worth it !!!",Needed a very good gym workout after this. I visited with my Indian colleague and let him do the ordering. Not always sure what I was eating but the food was delicious. Not overly spicy as I have found elsewhere.,"I ate at this place last year and really enjoyed it. Took my wife around 8 at night. The staff were very nice and helpful.We ordered lobster and crab.Maybe it was our mistake but the cost is as per weight and we should have asked the price. My wife's lobster was beautiful. On the other hand my crab was not so. I was served the green pepper sauce and sat waiting expectantly for the crab. I managed to embarrass myself by asking the waiter where my crab was to be told the green sauce WAS the crab.We laughed this off but then we got the bill. It was by far our most expensive meal in India. I have worked here 8 years and been blessed to eat at some wonderful places.The food, a bottle of local Indian wine and a couple of local beers was over £110. Nice but not worth this sort of price tag.My advice would be to check the price of the meal before you tuck in.",The restaurant lived up to its image of one the best seafood restaurants in the city. The appam and neer dosa with fish pepper grilled and mutton chettinad was. The restaurant is a bit high on price but the quality and taste justifies it!,"If you love seafood, you will love Trishna! This quirky little restaurant knows fish! Portions are large, but the server will help you navigate the extensive selections and the quantity. The Butter Garlic Crab, Grilled Pomfret and Creamed Spinach were more than enough for two, and were all out of this world!!!!Service is knowledgable and attentive.This was a marvelous night out!","Having read various reviews and had recommendations from both our hotel concierge and tour guide we were really looking forward to our meal.
