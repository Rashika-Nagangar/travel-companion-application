I visited by myself and the guy in charge of the service was so keen and patient on explaining me every single spice and how to try and combine every different plate. He spoke great English and made me feel very welcomed. I was even offered a ride back to the station as taxis were super hard to find at that time of the day. Will definitely come back as soon as I return to Mumbai. My recommendation would be to arrive with a very BIG appetite. Lunch time would be better as the meal is pretty huge and if you are not used to thali you’ll need some hours to digest.","Shree Thaker Bhojnalay - a restaurant that serves gujrati style thali, which is basically all you can eat menu consisting of different variety of dishes from the cuisine, from starters to desserts. The restaurant is located on Dadyseth Agiary Lane just off Kalbadevi Road and finding the same can be a little difficult task. The area is very congested and does not any space available for parking, so its best to walk down to the restaurant. 2 wheelers can be parked outside the restaurant, provided you get an empty space.The restaurant is located on 1st floor. Its an indoor seating area and the entry seems quite congested. The dining area of the restaurant is not that big, with around 15-20 tables in the whole place. Sometimes, it may happen that you have to share a big table with other people. The restaurant is generally crowded, so a waiting time of 15-20 mins can be expected. They have a small plank to sit, outside the restaurant for people to wait.The staff here is very polite and courteous. After taking down our names for the waiting list, he informed that we need to wait for sometime and he himself came to the waiting area and took us to our table. The moment we sat down, we were served cold water. The best part of the place is that everyone here gets mineral water and its not charged separately.The farsan consisted of dhokla, moong bhaji, fried papad and salad, with green chutney and imli chutney along with the farsan.In vegetables, they had 5 sabji’s – Bhindi, Aloo mutter, Chanda dal, palak and paneer. The paneer and palak were tasty, whereas other vegetables were ok. Dal and kadhi were offered in sweet Gujju style and non sweet. Rotis included phulka, jawar bhakri, puri and the traditional Gujju style small puran poli, which was drenched in ghee. The phulka’s are drenched in ghee and served hot, so you end up eating quite a lot than you should. To end the mains, we could choose from steamed rice and khichadi. In sweets there was Fruit salad, moong dal halwa and a Bengali sweet. The fruit salad was way too sweet however the Bengali sweet was amazing. Also they keep on serving Chaas, which is really helpful to digest the food. Unlike some other thali eateries, there were no restrictions on the servingsThe only negative of the place is that the price of the thali is Rs. 500 on normal days and Rs. 600 on weekends and holidays, which is quite high considering the variety of food being served.Note:1) Cost for 2 people – Rs. 10002) Waiting time of 15-20 mins, depending on the day of the week. ",The place is small and cozy. Serves rich quality food at affordable rates. I have visited this place and simply loved the way your thali is decorated and different items are placed in front of you.It is said that food must not only taste good but look good. This place fulfills both the criteria.,Overhyped. Good but not worth the effort of locating it. Many easier alternatives that are just as good. No plans to return I'm afraid.,"I couldn't find the restaurant; following the direction by gps.
