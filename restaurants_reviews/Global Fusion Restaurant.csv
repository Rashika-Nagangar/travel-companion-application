"My first ever experience in the restaurant in Bandra. Firstly, the ambience, the decor take you to another world when you enter. The decor, the lake, the table set-up are all rightly done. The buffet is amazingly good with a variety of food, be it Chinese, Japanese or Indian food. Great fushion I must say. The desserts are to die for. You can take whatever you would like, no restrictions!If you are in Bandra, near linking road, Global Fushion is a place to be. A bit over-rated for their Sunday price but the food and service are amazing. But, spend a good 2-3 hours there, relishing all the food you would like to have and have a super light breakfast if you are going for a lunch ;)","One of our favourite restaurants in Mumbai. Went for dinner buffet. Their starters spread is just amazing. Dumplings and sushi/ sashimi are top class and the cheese grilled prawns is a family favourite. Starters make you so full that you might hv to skip the main course, because dessert section is something you cannot miss. A very good variety of pastries, ice creams and Indian sweets were on the menu. All in all, a very satiating meal.We got the early bird rates as we finished before 9pm. ","We were 12 adults and two children at lunch on October 29 afternoon. Variety available was mind-boggling, catering to all tastes. So much good food, that even one was tempted to be a glutton ! Very polite support staff and pleasing ambience. High chairs for the children were very useful. We spent a pleasant over two hours with the family.",Visited this place for lunch yesterday and it was an extremely mediocre affair as far as the spread and the service was concerned. The only saving grace were the ice creams. Apparently there is some renovation going on due to which a portion of the restaurant was not accessible.Ideally they should concentrate on the quality rather than the quantity. The service also needs to improve.Overall not recommended.,A customer went me there for dunner after a difucult day. I think it was very good choice. The place was very good. The staff was very friendly. The cocktails and the food was amazing. I can't trll you abou the prices because my customer payed the bill.,"Its always good to celebrate at global fusion with family and friends as it offers a wide variety of buffet spread along with soft beverages and offers fabulous pan asian starters and a very good spread of mains which also has few indian mains, quality top notch. Sea food served of a good quality and prawns are bigger than the normal size thats a plus point! Desserts are the best as they have B&R counter as well and quite alot of variety in the desserts too Looking forward for my next celebration out there",Have been to Global Fusion some 5-6 times (once on a Sunday for brunch and rest of the time in evenings). This happens to be the safest place for me to take colleagues and family when there is a huge disparity in cuisine tastes amongst people; because Global Fusion has a great spread and literally serves almost all popular cuisines in its buffet. It has light snacks/starters for the health conscious so even better. Usually people end up stuffing themselves with starters only and have minimal main course. Great desserts counter too especially the Basking Robins counter for all kinds of ice cream flavors. The location is pretty central however parking is a little tight (a very narrow lane in the building) despite valets' availability,"Right place to be when bidding adieu to an old employee. Bandra location is always buzzing.Oriental food lover will love this place to the fullest extent.The office group went on a buffet I believe they have ala carte menue too. Nice ambience, awesome crew and variety of dishes and drinks for all sort of people under one roof. Highly recommended to all, prior reservation is an absolute must. ","On top of a mall , high roof & fish pond adds to the good ambience , it is a big place but still gets crowded on weekends. They have discount if you can finish the food before 9pm . Its a buffet only restaurant. the spread is awesome.. lots of Japanese / thai type of salads , sushi's , hot starters are great , you select & its served at the table piping hot.have tempura's , good choice of seafood , if you are looking for desi indian stuff , not much. But if you up for Asian food its just great.Normally try to visit this restaurant when am in Mumbai , been here 4~5 times since I found this 2 years ago, but each time by the time I finish with salads , soup , Starters , am so full that have to skip the main curries . Dessert is ok , good array of Baskin robins icecreams.btw the food is Halal","Make no mistake: this is a clean and delicious space. Think about a buffet-type format. They make good food of a pretty wide variety, sushi-to-indian-to-pasta. I found it lacked a soul or personal touch, the food was decent but not spectaculary. Many dishes grade B but no dish grade A.
