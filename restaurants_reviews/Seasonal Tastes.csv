Do visit,"Our server, Rishikesh Shinde, was super attentive during the entire time we were having our breakfast. He ensured our table was cleared of used cutlery whenever the opportunity arose. However, I hope the restaurant management would encourage their staff to only clear empty cups and/ or plates to reduce/ prevent wastage. Nonetheless, Rishikesh's (and his colleagues') warm demeanour would certainly be a plus point in considering to dine at Seasonal Tastes!",I went to the restaurant with a friend of mine there for lunch..
