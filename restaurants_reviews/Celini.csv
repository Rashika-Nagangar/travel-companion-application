"I had been there with my friends, I must say great experience and mouth watering food. I have been to other 5 star properties to dine but somewhere i felt the warmth is missing and i strongly believe it is because of the staff we get great service, the lady who served us( steffi) pleasant and very humble nature with always a smile. Thank you for the great service. Kudos","I'm not a big fan of any other food other than Indian fare. But after visiting Cellini ,I realised that that was because I had not tasted the actual authentic fare. Being a vegetarian ,I thought that my choices would be limited,but it was not soFresh green salad with goat cheese accompanied by minestrone soup was very appealing to the palette. They offer freshly baked sourbread with an aubergine dip which is superb..This is on the house.. Then I had pizza with goats cheese and pesto sauce which was absolutely mouth watering served on a thinnest of crusts.. Will definitely visit again..","Superb unapologetic Saturday brunch!!! Great Value for Money.To celebrate my son's birthday we decided to try this unique Italian brunch on Saturday. True to it's spirit they serve some real outstanding Italian food.Head Chef Allesendro personally looks after every guests requirement. Excellent Salad and cheese spread makes a nice beginning with unlimited pouring of wine. Those who eat only Vegetarian food always have limited choices in specialty restaurant but not here. We never felt short of choices in any of the courses.Pizza ,pasta and rissoto are made to order and served on the table .We tried veg pizza arabita with roasted garlic and goat cheese and mushroom risotto . They we're just awesome.Service is excellent ,live music adds to your mood of a lazy afternoon brunch.Desert spread was good but has some scope of improvement.If you want to enjoy excellent authentic Italian food and have a great treat guys go for it you will not be disappointed","Had been to celini for their Saturday brunch with friends and boy weren’t we so happy we chose celini.... the place itself is rocking with a live music band and awesome staff... we were assisted by Steffi Gomes, Darrell Fernandes and Savio Berneto from the service team... the service was quick, the servers made precise suggestions with regards to the menu and our every request was immediately fulfilled... and now let me come to the best part of our experience.... the “Food” , one can literally see the efforts put in presenting such amazing food as soon as you enter the restaurant. We were welcomed by an array of cold starters and salads as we entered celini... there are fresh breads to go along with an array of cold cuts, cheeses and innovative dressings to go along with the salads. Countless individual mini salads and hot food continue to add variety to the buffet...And to appreciate the man behind such amazing food , Chef.Alessandro.... he is a true humble magician... who puts all that love in he food that what makes it so visually appealing and also lip smacking .... Chef really makes sure all guests requests are catered to and there’s no space left in your belly by the time you leave.... team celini thank you for the warm service and awesome memories.... Btw ... thank you for the special birthday cake surprise..... keep rocking Celini...!!!!!","The restaurant is so good... it’s hard to describe it over a full belly , The Italian these guys serve is like Heaven to me ... The staff is so Friendly and Courteous it makes me wanna come back for sure ... My experience with the food was mind blowing , Thanks to Darell and Savio my aunt and I had a wonderful experience and Chef Gustavo whose skill is Fantastico .... Thanks a lot u guys it was a pleasure dining at Celini ...","Differentiated flavour , impeccable preparation and great service make this a great place for quick meetings and discussion . A leisurely weekend brunch could be enjoyed in the smattering of flavours dishes up by the chef . ",Excllent food Thanks to Chef Ganesh and his team for an exoctic food and Good service Service team very good and great job by everyone Steffy was very friendly and made us much more comfortable..,"Great restaurant with authentic Italian food and superior Indian service! Try the Diavola Pizza. Simply amazing. The staff is very attentive and always up for a quick chat. For dessert, I recommend the Tiramisu.",The other day I came in for dinner with my wife . The menu was a real wide spread . Not forgetting the beetroot ravioli and lamb rack . Although the staff were pretty good at their service . Aaron took really good care of our table with amazing service and wonderful recommendations. Will visit soon✌,"If you are looking for authentic Italian food spread , this is the place you got to be.
