"Went for a meal last evening with a vegan friend. Burma Burma hit five stars on every count. The food was beyond good. Absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding. We hadn't reserved a table - so we were made to sit on the bar counter - but that wasn't a problem at all. The place is vegetarian and serves no liquor, but is jam packed. We tasted the most delicious sauces and had the Burmese falafels - a bit like our massla vada tossed in a most delectable sauce. Also tried the 'dry' khao Sui which was outstanding. Loved the place. Will visit again. ",Very good service and food is also good! Special thanks to the suggestions by the owners for low spice food. Fulfilling.,"Burma Burma is one of the few completely vegetarian restaurants which offers so much different variety in the dishes. The staff was very courteous and very helpful. They also had 4 different sauces to go with the food. The quality of the food was just awesome . We tried to call for their signature dishes like Samosa soup, chilly tohu ( made out of chickpeas) and of course the khao suey. The soft buns with different fillings was also very good . One more restaurant has been added to my all favorite list. ",To start with - a warm welcome and we were suggested to have samosa soup & we went with their suggestion - trust me it was just too yummy. Do try out guys if u go here. Than we had a starter- which was notless than main course. We had stuff paratha with gravy. It was enough to get full. Again suggested by the hotel & it turned out to be suppa yummy. Lastly we had their deserts- presentation full marks n taste again full marks. In total - a must go place & a treat for veggie & jaines.,"Authentic, fresh, vegetarian and yummy food. I'm more of a non-vegetarian when it comes to eating out but for Burma Burma this was my second visit to the restaurant in 3 months considering the fact I stay 60kms away :-) imagine the taste and give it a try ","A Burmese cuisine vegetarian restaurant was a little difficult to digest when I read about it initially. My mom being a staunch vegetarian, I decided to take her for lunch here while we were visiting town ( South Mumbai)The first surprise was the eloborate menu. All the dishes were sounding so beautiful that it took us some time to actually make a decision. But we were glad for whatever we ordered. It didn't fail to make us go wow ! My mom being a traditional gujju, loved the food and me being the wild food experimenter, loved it too. The flavours were delicately balanced and the food presentation was good.The dish that really stayed on my mind for long was the avocado and vanilla ice cream. Not only was it refreshingly and deliciously different from usual deserts, but it was presented in quite a theatrical way and was a feast for the eye too.Whether u are a vegetarian or not, I sincerely suggest you try this place out. It's small, so getting a table is difficult. Suggest you book your table in advance.","Good ambience, good variety of food. Loved the Boba tea and Samosa soup. The service was quite slow and for a place which requires booking a week in advance I expected better service. The presentation for the Avocado ice cream was very interesting.","This place is tucked into a bylane of the busy Fort business district but accessible easily. Their decor is good, neither minimalistic nor ornate. Our table initially was directly in front of the aircon blast but they promptly shifted is to a more comfortable one.The waiter was helpful in guiding us thru the menu and food came quickly. All the courses were delicious, esp. the grilled sticky mushroom rice. Though they serve only vegetarian items, you don't miss meats as the vegetarian food is quite tasty. They don't serve alcohol which can be a deterrent to some guests.We look forward to coming back here.","Wow, just wow! Whent here for lunch and it was absolutely great. The setting inside is beautiful and the food was very very good. The mocktails were also great! Recommend the noodles curry and coconut curry. Paid only 1850 for this amazing 2p lunch (2 dishes, 1 rice, 2 drinks, incl tax and service charge).",The restaurant stood up to the expectations built up in prior reviews. The steamed buns and starters were great. Main course portions seemed a bit small Staff is very warm and accommodative.
