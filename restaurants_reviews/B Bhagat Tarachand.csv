Bhagat Tara Chand is very much famous in south mumbai, specially for dal tadka,khichya churi, Chass, fulka roti and many more... once in moth I visit here for lunch ya dinner","Food is Fantabulous. Yellow Dal, butter chapati, churi papad, chaach - all these are a must have. It's always crowded and most of the time you have to share table with others.",Best food available in this area please visit this once the food here is awesome the quality is the reason i have posted this review,Best vegetarian food and good desserts and Buttermilk to diget but too small and full during peak lunch hours.Good veg food and other dishes,Amazing taste of every damn dish you will try. You can always have more when you are here. :Loved the food totally.,"Best Punjabi food ever had,,,taste very yummy and delicious,,chaas bottle must try,,, nice place with family and friends and with large groups also","We decided to try Bhagat Tarachad after checking the ratings on Zomato. ""4.7"" is definitely not an easy thing to ignore. You can walk or take a taxi from Marine lines station. We decided to walk, its almost 1.5kms from station. Ambience is quite humble. We order Spcl Veg Thali. It is the only option in veg thali. They even serve Jain food. The prices that yiu see on the menu card are inclusive of taxes so no additional charges. Thali was good with 1 daal, 1 paneer sabzi, 1seasonal sabzi(in our case it was bhindi aaloo), 1 chole, 3 ghee dripping chapattis, jeera rice, 1 sweet(gulab jamun), and chaas. It is more than sufficient for one person. For Rs. 240 its definitely worth a try. ","B Bhagat Tarachand is one of the best restaurants in Mumbai. The place is spacious, well lit and staff is extremely well-mannered and alert. But the best part is the food that they offer.Papad Chura is yummy, Aloo jira, shev sabji and butter roti will make you lick your fingers and the chhans is the peak of your food exprence. The desert were also very scrumptious, Randi and well balanced in flavours wasn't too sweet!","Very good vegetarian restaurant in south mumbai...
