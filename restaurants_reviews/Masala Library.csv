"Wonderful food , presented in innovative ways. Tastes , textures and look of each dish is great. We had the 16 dish Tasting Menu which I would recommend for a real understanding of what the chef is aiming for . The service was excellent.","We tried the set menu , offered at masala library on our special lunch. The menu was well curated and dishes were a treat to the eyes! Every single dish presented in a unique manner. The taste, texture and color of the delicacies being served was all very unique and contrasted well with the unique serving plates.We were the first lucky ones to taste the ""galouti kebab"" and I must say it was simply irresistable.Must visit place for beautiful food.","after months of speculation of whether to have expensive food or not I finally went to ML BKC with my cousin last night before going I was advised by my cousin to do a pre booking, called up at reception staff said we accept booking only at 7:30 or for 10:00 pm slot , we tried our luck and went there and was told to wait for 10 mins and our table was ready , on entering all i could notice was white sheets covering all tables, we were offered last row, my cousin asked for lamb dish from the menu to which staff replied is not available so we order saag and with seekh kabab and dal makhani and naan n roti , i could not distinguish between the food i had here and any other restaurant offering food in a competitive prices it was saag gravy with kabab dropped in it n dal makhani was super and i was expecting that expensive naan will melt in mouth but i was wrong and gave feedback on the form as it was, expecting staff will ask for more detailed feedback .... i like the line......does anyone care for one more roti....","This is one of those places where you take someone on a date, someone whom you want to impress badly! The food is delectable and so is the presentation. But be prepared to shell out a heavy load out of your pocket.",Visited Masala Library last week awesome food fantastic ambience variety of dishes with equally lip smacking taste staff is very helpful and decent. Additional 5 stars for chef and his innovative dishes. Definitely a place to go with family and friends. If visiting ask for chefs speciality ,"This is the 2nd time I was here and not so much for the food but for the presentation with some friends. Must give them credit for working hard on quality of staff, training them and making them present well.What we had was :Almond curd with bonda...(basically dahi wada)PrawnsFish Mutton rogan JoshChicken masala Tomoto soup.Dahi vada and mutton rogan were good. The key was quality of meat and perfectly cooked. ..chicken was too raw though.Must credit the waiters with good knowledge and ability to explain the stuff that is being presented. Master chef kinda look and feel in every plate. Too expensive though. It cost us about 1500 per head without drinks.Overall one time place.",Visited the place today. The food is lovely. They offered a few complimentary dishes to arouse n mellow ur pallet during a course change. Overall a fantastic experience. A bit expensive place though... but worth it.,What they do with food simply amazed me!! Lovely people around...been a fan! Presentation of the food will create a vow in your eyes and taste of the food will simply add to this vow...,"My wife has been struggling to get reservation and we always needed to find alternate place because of non availability and today finally got the chance and right now sitting here having food.. not sure what it's all about.Beyond creating a stylish way to serve, there is nothing anything special about it. The tasting menu includes all the boring and sad wines one could imagine ... The food is also very average ! Just for one time visit..",I called up the hotel for table reservation. The person from the hotel attending indicated that there are only two slots for booking a table. One is at 7:30 pm and other at 10:00 pmI indicated that we have a group of 10 people coming from different directions in Mumbai and we may be able to stick to the timing as it depends on the traffic. He said sorry.... its our company policy ...you need to be at the hotel at sharp 8:00 pm other wise he will withdraw the reservation... it is like punching at the office/factory on time otherwise the HR will cut your salary. The person not flexible at all....,"Wonderful food , presented in innovative ways. Tastes , textures and look of each dish is great.
