"I read the rave reviews and decided I needed to go here for their brunch/lunch buffet. I was shocked to experience that what was being said was not true at all. If they call it a brunch, all the breakfast items were missing! No eggs, no cereal, no pancakes, and no waffles. Whoever said there is a huge spread really hasn't been to a quality brunch. Cold cuts were dumped in a corner. Salads were limp, looked dead and best not eaten. The Asian food other than dumplings was a massive disappointment. Even your favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant without a star rating will serve better food. The chat station was horrible. The person making the chat should be arrested just for not being able to make chats. The grill section had tasteless grills. They used frozen prawns. The continental food was horribly tasteless. Polenta and mashed potatoes with too much salt were inedible. A simple dish like potatoes in the jacket with cheese was bland and tasted like boiled potatoes. The Indian food was average or even less. The dal was watery and tasteless. The starters were again over salted. The desserts were a massive massive disappointment. They were not sweat and badly made. The tiramisu was a big let down. The service here was slow and average. The drinks were replaced very very slowly and we had to make repeated repeated requests. This buffet is just a waste of money and not worth even one tenth of the price they charge. The chef really needs to learn to cook and to taste it before he serves the guests. Better planning and better staff are needed here. Good quality and fresh seafood is not hard to procure in Mumbai but they serve frozen stuff!","Pondichery Cafe A Cafe at Sofitel BKC!! Had been to this place with my friend taste was good, ambience was awesome enjoyed a lot, their slow service which took almost half n hour for providing us a frappe!! Apart From This, The Ambience, Decor, Taste and Presentation was Upto the mark, With A Classy Look will take you to top of the world, i.e next to Heaven, but yess Lil bit quick Service is expected by this cafe :)","Whether it is Breakfast or Lunch or Dinner, the spread at Pondicherry gets bigger and Better, and it becomes difficult to choose sometimes or many a time. The service is impeccable and well dressed staff are at waiting to serve without any demur. Elton, Kanchan and others are on their feet and Service can not be better. And the Food is mouthwatering and delicious whether Veg or non-veg. And festival at different times of the year whether National or international can give you a surprise. The Quality is excellent whether it is food and/or service, and the wellness drinks offered can lead to a healthy time.","The ambience of sofitel is sophistication and brilliance personified. Spacious and manned by welcoming hospitable staff, that was my first impression of this elegant cafe.Thai Food Festival added colourful elan to the overall appeal of this place.Being true to its theme, the decor gave you all the Thai feels you need. Chiang Mai Umbrellas, exotic fruits and friendly smiles of well learned chefs, cooking yummiest of Thai delicacies - this is what a single glimpse of this festival offered. Though menu changes everyday but this are some of our favorites from the festival.Som tum :Green papaya salad freshly made by chef sorataj himself is just perfect! ""You might exhale fire like a dragon""Thai curry :Thai veg palate would be incomplete without their authentic curry. It will surely take your taste buds on a foodgasmic journey.Tom kha hed :Coconut and mushroom soup is surely a result of chef's art! It is very much satisfying and refreshing. Vegans this is a big treat for you all.The Desserts! Dont even get me started!Your taste buds will take a whole smooth trip to the seventh heavens! With ample variety of sweet treats for vegetarians and eggetarians; and Indian and western savouries, you are sure to gasp for more. Some solid sweet-gasms here!I'd like to thank Ranjeet for his excellent service!",Had lunch at Pondicherry Cafe on my daughters birthday.. The staff made the experience an amazing one with all the surprises they had in store for my daughter.,The food and service in Pondicherry Cafe are top notch. Do drop in and enjoy the taste of India and the world.,The spread is so mammoth that whenever I have been there for the buffet had skipped my breakfast that day and also had a light meal the previous night. Has to be a planned meal :-) for me. They have a various cuisines spread. I end up having fish from all of them. Its high value but for me once a year its worth it.,"Wonderful spread of food, and most importantly, superb service, and very kind Executive Chef who comes out and extend his help.
Thank you Elton, and Chef (sorry did not catch your name) for your kind help",A great repast Many dishes Many varieties Unfortunately due to a power outage as informed by Chef Shrikant the food was a trifle cold But no worries Rohan was quick to the rescue and promptly got us a plate full of piping hot foodThe rotis served were crispy and hot The chicken curry good The lahsooni chicken tikka was delectable The paneer tikka looked great but had no taste The south eastern counter was by far the best Kudos to Pradeep Rai the chef His stir fry veggies plus chicken was too goodLiked the prawn dimsum tooJason of the dessert counter deserves applause as well Made a great Berry Framboise ! A must haveLoved the Estrezy And the chocolate berry as well Ice creams are from London Dairy Overall a 3.5 but for the dessert special it becomes a four,"We were spending the weekend at Sofitel, .. we had a couple of meals at Pondicherry cafe.. This time we were taken care of by Prashant and for the first time we really enjoyed being taken care off, not only politely but with a smile and personal attention.. The food is good, not great.. but the overall experience was great unlike our previous visits, in fact for our overall stay, we were served much better..So if you are in the vicinity, feel like a 5 star with good food, and good service, do drop in.. P.S. The portions though are only for one.. ","I read the rave reviews and decided I needed to go here for their brunch/lunch buffet.
