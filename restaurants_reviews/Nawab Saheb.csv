"My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant. I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant. They made me feel like family.If you visit the restaurant on the weekend, live music, featuring traditional Indian music, will add to your dining experience, as it did for me.",The food and ambience here is really nice and its a great way to experience real Indian food and at the same time make sure that you won't suffer from any stomach issues. We had the large tasting menu and all dishes were of very high quality. 1 advice: stay away from the paan (bethel leave sweet),We arrived at this restaurant and were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. The service was prompt and the menu explained in detail by Azad who continued to serve us throughout the meal. The food was delicious and was served in copper plates that are traditional to the Royal classes of India. On two occasions through our very tasty meal Purvesh (the chef) came over to ask if his cooking was to our liking! Fully recommend this beautiful restaurant and special thanks to Azad and Purvesh who really went the extra mile to ensure our visit was something to remember. Absolutely brilliant. ,"Had dinner at Nawab saheb - this is an Indian restaurant located within the Renaissance Hotel at Powai. The restaurant is well furnished with tall ceilings and nice decor. They have live Indian music in the evenings with a good singer - we started our dinner at around 7 15 PM and had the restaurant and the singing all to our selves. By 8:30 the restaurant started filling up - seems to be quite popular - the food was exceptional - we went for the set meal, one Vegetarian and the other non vegetarian - this comes with a set of unlimited starters. the non vegetarian had 2 types of chicken, one fish and two lamb starters - all of them were superb. The main course was also good but we were already full with the starters. The desert options were also huge - overall a great experience with great food and soothing music. ","The set menu is a fantastic way to experience a number of different dishes. Presented beautifully, and in a lovely environment, it was a great introduction for me to traditional North Indian dishes. I’m used to South Indian food, and was pleased to get some tips on how a couple of the fish dishes were prepared. Looking forward to another night here, for sure!",I have visited most of the fine dine restaurants. the consistency is appreciated. Chef Younus is one of the finest chefs in the country. Kudos,"Whenever I have a strong craving for good north indian or punjabi food, Nawab Sahab is the place I visit. It's is really disappointing to be in mumbai if you love good, spicy and rich north indian food because most of the places here are serving food with gujrati or south indian food flavours and forget authenticity, but this is one place where you feel like you are enjoying your food in Delhi restaurant. Dal Lakhani & Deserts are to die for.","The whole experience was royal, good ambience and enjoyed lovely live Ghazals on Saturday with Dinner booked thru Eatigo. Opted for set meals which provide a range of options from Non veg, Sea food as well as Mix and Match. The appetizers were well succulent and delicious in taste and served with a lot of interest and patience which added a notch to the eating experience. The mains were equally well prepared and went well with the garlic nans and laccha parathas. The wide desert spread had something for everyone from fresh fruits, indian sweets like gulab jamuns, ras malai and also ice cream. The staff were immaculate in their service and special thanks to ""Jayshree"" and team to help make this a memorable dining experience. Strongly recommended if you are a food lover and would like to relish a lavish indian spread + great service.",Lovely ambience. Lovely hospitality. Jayshree. Very careing. Very delicious and light food They entire team including the chef is very careing hospitable . I love this place and would recommend people to come here to have a lovely candle light dinner. ,This one is worth the visit since the food is very very tasty and it is also service oriented one.rates are manageable,"My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant.
