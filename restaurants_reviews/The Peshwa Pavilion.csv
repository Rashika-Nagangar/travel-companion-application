"Tried some awesome breakfast at the Peshwa, ITC Maratha. Since I was alone I couldn't taste many of the things I would have liked to so chose to try the signature breakfast dishes, and what a good decision that turned out to be! I tried the silky pearl millet custard with coconut milk, buckwheat cinnamon roll, eggs Benedict and some herbed rice with chicken stroganoff. All were delightful. The Sr. Sous Chef, Jayesh and the patisserie chef Bhavesh indulged my culinary enthusiasm by answering my questions about their craft.","The more I eat at the Pavilion, the more annoyed I become about the service. So this is going to be a bit of a complaint/negative review, even though the food is pretty tasty and having a lot of variety. Had I eaten at the restaurant only a few times, these might not have stood out as issues, but because I'm eating there multiple times per week, I have started to see trends that bother me.Some of the issues I take with the service at the restaurant include:* Being seated at a table with food crumbs on the chairs.* Having to ask for butter at breakfast half of the time. The other half of the time they have butter waiting on the table. * Being asked if I want coffee by the hostess, and then having to ask a waiter to bring it. Sometimes the coffee comes, sometimes I have to ask.* Having to ask every single time for a refill on coffee or house water. They never proactively ask me if I want more, even when my cup is empty.* Waiters are too eager to clear plates. Often times, seconds after I put the fork down, a waiter asks if they can clear the plate. Why are they so focused on plate removal but are blind to the need for more coffee or water?* Being served compulsory starters at a buffet (lunch and dinner). This is something that just confuses me greatly. A buffet is about choice. Why do servers automatically deliver items to my table that I didn't ask for? When I eat at a buffet, I want the foods I want, not what they want for me. I know they are included in the buffet, but allow me to ask for them, or give me a choice. Or put those foods on the buffet line itself! Food is wasted when its delivered to me and I don't want it. Why the starters and not, for example, Indian breads? Indian breads are included in the buffet and made to order, but they never deliver them automatically - they ask me first, and I've always said no.* Being charged for something I didn't have. The lunch buffet includes beverages, but there is a line item charge for it on the check (buffet for one price, beverages for another price). I only drink water at lunch, so I declined beverages, and they still charged for me it. I complained to the waiter, but he said they had to break it out on the bill due to GST calculations. Whatever their reasons are, I find it frustrating to see charges for beverages that I didn't have.* Blind devotion to service as trained and not towards what the guest needs. In a hospitality setting, it is all about the guest, but I often feel I am participating in a tightly choreographed play where waiters do exactly as their are told/trained and are not aware of what a guest needs. They also ask too many questions for my preference. Often times at a meal, 5 or more staff members come to my table, ask me how I'm doing, if I need anything. Do I want Indian bread? Do I need anything? Is the food good? Am I having a nice stay at the hotel? It was charming at first, but having stayed at the hotel for some time, its starting to bother me.My advise to the team would be, if a guests asks you 4 times in a meal for a refill of coffee, start watching me to see if I need a refill. I would rather you tailor your service in this way rather than go according to the playbook, like asking me if I want Indian breads when my coffee cup is almost empty.","Good restaurant with good spread of buffet. Enjoyed everything, will surely visit again. Must say have witnessed a gr8 service.","Ambience so relaxing though you are just outside the busy international airport.
was there with friends from dubai and new Zealand. an informal business lunch. my guests loved the place returned for dinner too","Usually when you are away from home, you expect little extra care. Shreya bhate has been very friendly. She has been closely observing when I order tea. After few days, I didn’t have to order TEA. She will serve on right time. On my fasting day, she showed concern about my meal & packed frits for me. Shreya bhate has caring nature that is an asset to Service Industry. My best wishes for Shreya bhate. Thanks for taking good care of me.","The wide and sumptuous breakfast served at Peshwa pavilion , coupled with a very refreshing natural daylight gushing in from the roof of the atrium makes a great start to a lovely day. Chef Kashi helps make it a delight with his special personalised attention and hospitality. ","My previous review was about the hotel. We dined at their other restaurants and the first was Peshwa Pavilion.As you enter, you are received and greeted by a polite lady who helps you with a table of your choice. Trust me, we changed three tables before we finally settled.The setup is magnificent with an amazing view up to the ceiling which is 5 floors above from where the sunlight lightens the entire restaurant. The architecture incorporates the Gate Way Of India and the Victoria Terminals.The food is as beautiful as its architecture. A wide array of dishes across cuisines. One can have anything of their choice. A little turn down was their biryani. We did not find it as interesting and tasty as it should have been. They do serve good deserts also. They have a great team which serves you exceptionally well.Final word - Recommended.","What amazing food we have had here! Love! The prices are really affordable, too. Expect to pay between 800 - 1500 Rupees per meal (excl. tax).","Their buffet offers top Indian dishes as well as some European cuisine. Apart from what is on display, they also offer additional items freshly prepared, such as yellow Dal, Rotis etc They also bring to your table a selection of starters. We stuck to Indian food and were not disappointed. The service is prompt and friendly. This restaurant is open 24 hours!",Excellent. Always look forward to breakfast. All the hotel waiters are very friendly and helpful. Would also like to specially compliment one of them Sachin today. Took the trouble to explain what certain foods were and was helpful and friendly. He even took notice the timing I go down for breakfast daily -- attention to detail I must say.,"Tried some awesome breakfast at the Peshwa, ITC Maratha.
