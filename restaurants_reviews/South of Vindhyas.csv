"If you are a foodie or not a foodie, looking for authentic south indian food and Maharastrian dishes with the spicness of the authentic taste - you MUST not miss having breakfast at the Vindhyas.ALL items prepared by Chef Balasubramanian win hands on in taste, freshnes, authenticity of preparation. Also, the serving portions are just enough - so that you can partake many items. Want to repaet eating the same item ? No problem eat it any amount , as many times you like.Try Thalipeet with Methkoot ( Grinded Meethi powder - fenugreek seeds powder), Misal pav, Sheera ( a sweet dish), Coin idli, Methi toast, Venkatesh Dosa - the list is long.",You walk in to the grand entrance and are treated well...the papadums and pickle and the decor take you back down south..the food is great have mutton Chettinad style was well cooked and stew was lovely.. however it's surely tad over priced,"I was staying at the Orchid Hotel in Mumbai and this was one of several restaurants in the hotel. They do breakfast, lunch and dinner however I only ate here for dinner and they open quite late which is useful after a full business day and then attacking the Mumbai traffic! I ate here on three occasions as it was really good and the service was excellent. The a la carte menu was quite varied and they also do a buffet/banquet option which I didn't try. The dishes that I had were really tasty and I had them with a variety of breads. Cost wise I think this was marginally more expensive than I had eaten at other similar restaurants in the city, but is probably expected as the Orchid hotel is 5 star. After all the various surcharges and taxes the cost soon mounts up. The bottled water which they offer is not free and costs virtually the same as a bottle of beer. Great attentive service.","Buffet veg breakfast was enjoyable, the selection was noteworthy.
ENjoyed the Rava dosa, poories and accompaniments. worth a try. madras filter coffee is sought after.",Serves breakfast as well. Ideal choice for South Indian food lovers specially Vegetarians. Had breakfast most of the days during stay. Good breakfast platter.,I'd say quite tasty dishes as you'd expect in a south indian restaurant .. To top it the place had amazing live music performance (classical). Mesmerizing.,I visited this place for breakfast. Excellent food.Excellent staff. The variety of south Indian food is unlimited.. You will be full but their serving won't stop. They have mini version of all south Indian delicious. Coffee is just refreshing... You can keep on ordering. Amazing!,Visited south of vindhya for it's varied and delecious breakfast. They are offering traditional thali also but decided to taste breakfast. What a selection n presentation. All items prepared amd displaced Puri bhaji masala Puri sweet Puri Kolkata kachori venkatesh dosa and other rare items. Tried almost everything that is served in splatter. Tiny idli. Also.tried Gujarati items ghoogra jalebj and nylon khaman. Summed it with masala chai. Nicely served by waiters in traditional attires.,"They have very good southern, pure veg breakfast spread. I also had dinner here but did not find the same uniqueness which I experienced in the morning. Good for breakfast","Again excellent crew ushers you from the lobby and offers you seats of your choice.
