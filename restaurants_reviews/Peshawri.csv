"This place never ceases to amaze. The ambiance, service, knowledge of the waiters and above all the quality of their food is faultless. The restaurant was almost full (we arrived around 9 pm) - glad we had made a reservation. We were immediately sat at our table. The service was quick and friendly. We went with the waiter’s suggestions from the menu and the food was simply stunning. A trip to Mumbai wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Peshawri!","Came late on a Tuesday evening for a meal with work colleagues. The food is amazing - you have to try the speciality lamb dish, the meat just falls off the bone and tastes so good.Probably some of the best Indian food i've ever eaten.Great to also watch the chef's preparing the food in the glass fronted kitchen.",This restaurant will lure the occasional meat eater to become a full blown carnivore. The Raan is the highlight. As is the Dal. Those two jewels alone are enough to make a person visit this place again and again! :-),This is the Mumbai colleague of Bukahra in Delhi - which is one of the most famous restaurants in India. It lives up to the same consistent quality & freshness of the tandoori grilled meats & especially the dal. It is in ITC 5 star hotel - it is not meant to be cheap so if you think on this level you are in the wrong place. Great service & ambience.,"ok, the food is ok. It is well cooked and prepared, but nothing that spectacular. The normal street food restaurant will get similar results. Mostly the ordinary restaurants will be better spiced.But then the rip-off starts. You have to pay for PLAIN WATER !!! Roti for 60-100rupies per piece. And nothing special. You really only pay for the ambience. if you can avoid, then do so, or only consume the DAL thadarka without any drinks. Alt least the onions are free","The place has a wide variety of mouth watering cuisines especially the mughlai food.The food, the service and the ambiance made it a great experience for us.","One of the best restaurant i ever went, its near to mumbai airport and best peshavari food even i had here. Staff is good wel experience.
If u going there near by u guys need to visit them.",Delicious palate to fill up your taste bud. The most authentic mughlai cuisine with wide variety of cuisine to choose from.,"Atmosphere maybe not the best, but the meals could not be faulted! Large portions of both chicken and lamb dishes (we shared!) and the Dal Bukhara with Naan probably the highlight!!",Had a great dinner with nice staff and food to eat with fingers only. Not too spicy. Try different dishes to share. Don’t forget raita!,"This place never ceases to amaze.
