I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant.

Miss Alrina Dsouza was the associate that helped my mother be at ease and helped her with her choice of food and beverage. Miss Kim made sure that our table was crumble free and that we had a clean set of plates and cutlery after every course. Mr. Partha made sure to come and check on us at frequent intervals and made sure that we were comfortable and that we had a great time. Romano's is the place to be at when one wishes to be treated royally. They'll make sure that the guests have nothing to complain about. They'll do more than what's asked of them to make sure the guest leaves the restaurant with a smile on his/her face. And not to mention, they were damn sweet to get us a complimentary pizza. Love and Best wishes to the entire team. Thank you for making this birthday a special one. P.S My mother loved the Berry Ice tea, Polpette and the salmon steak.

Since I was alone I couldn't taste many of the things I would have liked to so chose to try the signature breakfast dishes, and what a good decision that turned out to be! I tried the silky pearl millet custard with coconut milk, buckwheat cinnamon roll, eggs Benedict and some herbed rice with chicken stroganoff. All were delightful. The Sr. Sous Chef, Jayesh and the patisserie chef Bhavesh indulged my culinary enthusiasm by answering my questions about their craft.\",\n",
       "   u\"The more I eat at the Pavilion, the more annoyed I become about the service. So this is going to be a bit of a complaint/negative review, even though the food is pretty tasty and having a lot of variety. Had I eaten at the restaurant only a few times, these might not have stood out as issues, but because I'm eating there multiple times per week, I have started to see trends that bother me.Some of the issues I take with the service at the restaurant include:* Being seated at a table with food crumbs on the chairs.* Having to ask for butter at breakfast half of the time. The other half of the time they have butter waiting on the table. * Being asked if I want coffee by the hostess, and then having to ask a waiter to bring it. Sometimes the coffee comes, sometimes I have to ask.* Having to ask every single time for a refill on coffee or house water. They never proactively ask me if I want more, even when my cup is empty.* Waiters are too eager to clear plates. Often times, seconds after I put the fork down, a waiter asks if they can clear the plate. Why are they so focused on plate removal but are blind to the need for more coffee or water?* Being served compulsory starters at a buffet (lunch and dinner). This is something that just confuses me greatly. A buffet is about choice. Why do servers automatically deliver items to my table that I didn't ask for? When I eat at a buffet, I want the foods I want, not what they want for me. I know they are included in the buffet, but allow me to ask for them, or give me a choice. Or put those foods on the buffet line itself! Food is wasted when its delivered to me and I don't want it. Why the starters and not, for example, Indian breads? Indian breads are included in the buffet and made to order, but they never deliver them automatically - they ask me first, and I've always said no.* Being charged for something I didn't have. The lunch buffet includes beverages, but there is a line item charge for it on the check (buffet for one price, beverages for another price). I only drink water at lunch, so I declined beverages, and they still charged for me it. I complained to the waiter, but he said they had to break it out on the bill due to GST calculations. Whatever their reasons are, I find it frustrating to see charges for beverages that I didn't have.* Blind devotion to service as trained and not towards what the guest needs. In a hospitality setting, it is all about the guest, but I often feel I am participating in a tightly choreographed play where waiters do exactly as their are told/trained and are not aware of what a guest needs. They also ask too many questions for my preference. Often times at a meal, 5 or more staff members come to my table, ask me how I'm doing, if I need anything. Do I want Indian bread? Do I need anything? Is the food good? Am I having a nice stay at the hotel? It was charming at first, but having stayed at the hotel for some time, its starting to bother me.My advise to the team would be, if a guests asks you 4 times in a meal for a refill of coffee, start watching me to see if I need a refill. I would rather you tailor your service in this way rather than go according to the playbook, like asking me if I want Indian breads when my coffee cup is almost empty.\",\n",

We went for spinach wrapped chicken and Edamame truffle dumplings to begin with. The bbq'd black pepper and kaffir lamb chops were to die for! And lastly we went for flaming mud cake - speechless about this one.All in all, I highly recommend this place as the food, ambience & service are all beyond the mark.

       "   u\"Staying in my favourite Mumbai business hotel I have finally been able to try By The Mekong.This is an excellent place to try if you want absolutely first class Asian from a wide ranging menu in central Mumbai.With excellent views, plenty of room between tables for those intimate dinners or business conversations, superb service and some of the best Asian food I have tried anywhere in the world this location is unmissable.A great wine list compliments the offering.I did mention to the manager that I am still a little surprised in travels in Mumbai restaurants that with the extraordinary quality now of first class locations such as this that they still insist on serving automatic machine coffee. It must only be a matter of time before the trend in the rest of the world to cap off a great meal with barista quality caffeine arrives in India's financial capital also !Still, this wonderful establishment is highly recommended\",\n",

       "   u'I arrived quite late and the hotel staff helped me secure dinner (despite the kitchen closing in less than 5 minutes). In particular, Subhankar was a great waiter. He made excellent recommendations given I had to order quickly and kept me company without ever imposing. Only in India and at the St Regis could I receive such thoughtful and caring service. Highly recommend the \\u201cBy the Mekong Chicken\\u201d \\u2014 wonderful rich dish with moderate spice.Highly-recommend for business and romantic dinners. Great views of the south of Mumbai.',\n",
       "   u'Went back to By The Mekong after quite a while....It\\u2019s got an amazing view and the food is to die for We had the edamame dim sim & veg crystal dumpling for starters, both were very good. For mains the noodles & mix vegetables were exotic, The green Thai curry was mellow and gelled very well with the noodlesThe hazelnuts cherry pastry was too goodArnold took very care of us and Siddhi, Uday & Nemish were very prompt in serving us smilingly...Would highly recommend this place and would definitely go back....',\n",
       "   u\"It's always best place to visit again and again. Food is amazing with excellent staff. The best Asian restaurant in Mumbai. The ambience is also good.\",\n",
       "   u\"I visited Mumbai to meet my best friend and he suggested that we go for Asian cuisine. I am honestly not a fan, but was convinced has he spoke highly of the place and the food. I would have really regretted if had turned him down. The restaurant is beautiful! It is located on the 37th floor and sea view is just mesmerising. The food too was a delight. We went for spinach wrapped chicken and Edamame truffle dumplings to begin with. The bbq'd black pepper and kaffir lamb chops were to die for! And lastly we went for flaming mud cake - speechless about this one.All in all, I highly recommend this place as the food, ambience & service are all beyond the mark. I am glad my friend took me here.\",\n",

       "   u'Shree Thaker Bhojnalay - a restaurant that serves gujrati style thali, which is basically all you can eat menu consisting of different variety of dishes from the cuisine, from starters to desserts. The restaurant is located on Dadyseth Agiary Lane just off Kalbadevi Road and finding the same can be a little difficult task. The area is very congested and does not any space available for parking, so its best to walk down to the restaurant. 2 wheelers can be parked outside the restaurant, provided you get an empty space.The restaurant is located on 1st floor. Its an indoor seating area and the entry seems quite congested. The dining area of the restaurant is not that big, with around 15-20 tables in the whole place. Sometimes, it may happen that you have to share a big table with other people. The restaurant is generally crowded, so a waiting time of 15-20 mins can be expected. They have a small plank to sit, outside the restaurant for people to wait.The staff here is very polite and courteous. After taking down our names for the waiting list, he informed that we need to wait for sometime and he himself came to the waiting area and took us to our table. The moment we sat down, we were served cold water. The best part of the place is that everyone here gets mineral water and its not charged separately.The farsan consisted of dhokla, moong bhaji, fried papad and salad, with green chutney and imli chutney along with the farsan.In vegetables, they had 5 sabji\\u2019s \\u2013 Bhindi, Aloo mutter, Chanda dal, palak and paneer. The paneer and palak were tasty, whereas other vegetables were ok. Dal and kadhi were offered in sweet Gujju style and non sweet. Rotis included phulka, jawar bhakri, puri and the traditional Gujju style small puran poli, which was drenched in ghee. The phulka\\u2019s are drenched in ghee and served hot, so you end up eating quite a lot than you should. To end the mains, we could choose from steamed rice and khichadi. In sweets there was Fruit salad, moong dal halwa and a Bengali sweet. The fruit salad was way too sweet however the Bengali sweet was amazing. Also they keep on serving Chaas, which is really helpful to digest the food. Unlike some other thali eateries, there were no restrictions on the servingsThe only negative of the place is that the price of the thali is Rs. 500 on normal days and Rs. 600 on weekends and holidays, which is quite high considering the variety of food being served.Note:1) Cost for 2 people \\u2013 Rs. 10002) Waiting time of 15-20 mins, depending on the day of the week.\\u2003',\n",

       "   u'This place never ceases to amaze. The ambiance, service, knowledge of the waiters and above all the quality of their food is faultless. The restaurant was almost full (we arrived around 9 pm) - glad we had made a reservation. We were immediately sat at our table. The service was quick and friendly. We went with the waiter\\u2019s suggestions from the menu and the food was simply stunning. A trip to Mumbai wouldn\\u2019t be complete without a visit to Peshawri!',\n",
       "   u\"Came late on a Tuesday evening for a meal with work colleagues. The food is amazing - you have to try the speciality lamb dish, the meat just falls off the bone and tastes so good.Probably some of the best Indian food i've ever eaten.Great to also watch the chef's preparing the food in the glass fronted kitchen.\",\n",
       "   u'This restaurant will lure the occasional meat eater to become a full blown carnivore. The Raan is the highlight. As is the Dal. Those two jewels alone are enough to make a person visit this place again and again! :-)',\n",
       "   u'This is the Mumbai colleague of Bukahra in Delhi - which is one of the most famous restaurants in India. It lives up to the same consistent quality & freshness of the tandoori grilled meats & especially the dal. It is in ITC 5 star hotel - it is not meant to be cheap so if you think on this level you are in the wrong place. Great service & ambience.',\n",
       "   u'ok, the food is ok. It is well cooked and prepared, but nothing that spectacular. The normal street food restaurant will get similar results. Mostly the ordinary restaurants will be better spiced.But then the rip-off starts. You have to pay for PLAIN WATER !!! Roti for 60-100rupies per piece. And nothing special. You really only pay for the ambience. if you can avoid, then do so, or only consume the DAL thadarka without any drinks. Alt least the onions are free',\n",

Really liked all the non vegetarian dishes that we had ordered Prawns seekh tandoor, kheema ghotala, white pepper chicken, quail tandoor. The vegetarian platter could be improved.

       "   u\"Took one of my Mumbai teams for lunch on the 27th of Oct, 2017. This restaurant and it's sister (Madeira & Mime) take social responsibility to the next level by hiring waitstaff and cooks who are deaf / mute and you need to use (Indian) sign language to communicate. No worries - the menu has the signs you need to order food and drinks. Baljeet our head-waiter was fantastic and she served my group of 20+ ever complaining professionals with a smile and the food shut them up :). If you are brave - go for the chicken lollipops flavored with ghost pepper. Paneer Seekh is not to be missed and you will curse yourself if you never tasted the Prawn Curry or the Rajma Chawal (yes - you read that right). Lastly, it is sacrilege to leave without having the faluda ...Overall the food was excellent, service was very friendly and efficient and the social IQ of the owners to employ those who are usually discarded by the wayside of Indian society and integrate them into highend dining is just exquisite - and you can see the happiness written across the face of the service staff and the kitchen hands. This is not a sad place - and it makes you happy too.Get there *early* and you will NOT regret it.\",\n",

       "   u\"Kudos to the owner for this amazing concept! We went there on busy weekend evening for dinner. We didn't have reservation but they have outdoor section for walk in guests. We went there early so could grab the seats without waiting. Service was bit sluggish given how busy the restaurant was. All the wait staff are verbally challenged but are very courteous. Coming to food, quantity of certain dishes especially starters is small. We had mocktails which also were overpriced. But main course was very very good. Overall fantastic food and good service. But it's a real shame that they don't give finger bowls instead they provide wet tissues. A restaurant of this stature in my opinion should not cut corners in such small things.

The special care that the staff takes, with my filter coffee every time I enter the restaurant and the tender coconut water, to special alloo paratha made to order. More importantly Fabian A, is the main manager and he takes extra care of us all. Do want to say a Special thanks to Mr Adhaar in reservations, Mr Gabba (F&B Manager), Rushad at front desk, Mr Sandeep the Concierge; and most importantly the GM Mr Kerman Lalkaka. The great customer service starts from the top and goes throughout the hotel system. \",\n",

       "   u'Went for a Sunday brunch buffet. The spread was vast with multiple cuisines. Thank you to chef Aditi who made a point to give a tour of different dishes, explaining us what went well with what and explaining us about different types of cheese. The cherry on top was the freshly cooked pizza by the chef. The hospitality and the ambience was just perfect for a relaxed, laid back Sunday afternoon. Hope to visit again soon!',\n",
       "   u\"My family and I have been going to Mumbai for many decades. We always stay at ITC Grand Everytime, and one of the highlights of the trip is the breakfast and meals at Hornby's Pavalion. I just love the morning breakfast, the special dosas made by Chef Rajan. The special care that the staff takes, with my filter coffee every time I enter the restaurant and the tender coconut water, to special alloo paratha made to order. More importantly Fabian A, is the main manager and he takes extra care of us all. Do want to say a Special thanks to Mr Adhaar in reservations, Mr Gabba (F&B Manager), Rushad at front desk, Mr Sandeep the Concierge; and most importantly the GM Mr Kerman Lalkaka. The great customer service starts from the top and goes throughout the hotel system. \"],\n",

Thali was good with 1 daal, 1 paneer sabzi, 1seasonal sabzi(in our case it was bhindi aaloo), 1 chole, 3 ghee dripping chapattis, jeera rice, 1 sweet(gulab jamun), and chaas.

Honestly i was never so keen about Italian food and it was only for my wife's love for Italian food that we ended up here. But my visit to Prego changed it all. I have never ever known Italian food to be this amazing.I had very bad opinions about minestrone soup but the one i had here was the best. The Aglio Olio peperoncino pasta and Risotto was mouth watering and as a matter of surprise my mother who never loved eating pasta had it to her hearts content.I thank Chef. Vishal Sawant for this sumptous feast of amazing Italian food who was also kind enough to attend our table personally and know our opinions regarding the food. Most of all i am thankful to him for a surprise cake he arranged for my mom. That was really sweet. I would also thank Ms. Mubba for offering her kind and polite service at our table. My mother was really pleased to have such an amazing and memorable birthday.All in all a must visit for all Italian food lovers. You will love it !!! \",\n",
       "   u'I did my best to find the best Italian restaurant in town to give a memorable experience to my one and only...Along came the MIL and the SIL, who have never had authentic italian culinary experience and have there fair share of Indian curries and are Masters in the Indian Kitchen. The Girls had a once in a life time experience and I hope I was able to give a lasting impression on the one who matters the most to me... The food was Authentic...( check out the bill(pic) for the Items ordered)... Its a fine dinning place at the Westin garden city in Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharastra, India...So expect to get your moneys worth...not crowded... located in quaint area of the Property with a few giggles...Brought back many memories of my one off ten day trip to Italy in 2011...I definitely recommend it ...',\n",

First it seemed they had 'lost' her order, some time later it became, clear they then forgot to forward it to the kitchen. Only when someone from us escalated to managament, the order came through.

       "   u\"We were at Prego for my sons birthday and since he is an Italian food fan we opted for Prego. We didn't go there with any great expectations but boy, were we wrong!! The food is authentic Italian which is the best ingredients combined with masterful combinations and the best cooking techniques. We loved every dish we ordered but would like to mention the some we loved the most the Carpatio Manzo , Prosciutto and the crab Taglioli. Our family is typically non-veg biased but even the Asparagi soup is to die for. Chef Anto is a master of his craft and a special mention to Mona, who ensured that we had the best time with prompt and interactive service and some good recommendations. This is pure Italian cuisine so don't expect any fusion and they also have a great veg selection. Its surprisingly Value for money considering the ambiance and cuisine quality and we had the Yes Bank offer too, that was a sweetner. This definitely warrants a second visit, hopefully shortly!! Oh did I mention that Chef Anto sings !!\",\n",

The experience was ruined by Keval Soni as he started hurling abuses at the staff In a staff meeting just round the corner. When we shared a glance instead of being apologetic of the behaviour he was rude with a retort. ',\n",
       "   u\"I decided to celebrate my Mothers birthday at Prego and i could not have got a better place to do so. Honestly i was never so keen about Italian food and it was only for my wife's love for Italian food that we ended up here. But my visit to Prego changed it all. I have never ever known Italian food to be this amazing.I had very bad opinions about minestrone soup but the one i had here was the best.

       "   u'Stopped for Buffet Lunch on the way to the airport. They have a Papri Chaat, Golgappas, Sev Puri counters which provide decent taste but I have had better tasting stuff by the roadside. They have extensive selection of salads and cheese which I could not try since we went at 2.30 p.m. and were informed at 2.45 that they would close at 3.00 which was a surprise to us. Someone should have told us in advance when we sat down to eat - or they expect guests to enter a \"who eats fastest contest\" and finish the buffet in 30 minutes. They also have soups and starters and main course and desserts. Pressed for time I only had time for Pasta in Arrabiata sauce which was excellent and in fact the highlight of the buffet. For main course being a vegetarian I had Paneer Khurchan - avoidable, Bhindi ka Salan - essentially pieces of Bhindi in Salan which didnt taste like Salan (salan is supposed to be spicy but insipid taste here), Aloo (excellent cooked south indian way), Pachranga Dal - not upto the mark - Overall a 2 star rating for main course. Desserts were good and the Rose flavoured Kulfi could have been excellent but for the fact that it was too sweet.However the service was very good and the service staff was constantly monitoring our needs and fetching us whatever we required. Since the place is in the looby , it is quite noisy and if you are looking for a quite place to have food, best avoided',\n",

       "   u\"A Burmese cuisine vegetarian restaurant was a little difficult to digest when I read about it initially.

All the dishes were sounding so beautiful that it took us some time to actually make a decision. But we were glad for whatever we ordered. It didn't fail to make us go wow ! My mom being a traditional gujju, loved the food and me being the wild food experimenter, loved it too. The flavours were delicately balanced and the food presentation was good.The dish that really stayed on my mind for long was the avocado and vanilla ice cream. Not only was it refreshingly and deliciously different from usual deserts, but it was presented in quite a theatrical way and was a feast for the eye too.Whether u are a vegetarian or not, I sincerely suggest you try this place out. It's small, so getting a table is difficult. Suggest you book your table in advance.\",\n",

All the courses were delicious, esp. the grilled sticky mushroom rice. Though they serve only vegetarian items, you don't miss meats as the vegetarian food is quite tasty. They don't serve alcohol which can be a deterrent to some guests.We look forward to coming back here.\",\n",

The decor, the lake, the table set-up are all rightly done. The buffet is amazingly good with a variety of food, be it Chinese, Japanese or Indian food. Great fushion I must say. The desserts are to die for. You can take whatever you would like, no restrictions!If you are in Bandra, near linking road, Global Fushion is a place to be. A bit over-rated for their Sunday price but the food and service are amazing. But, spend a good 2-3 hours there, relishing all the food you would like to have and have a super light breakfast if you are going for a lunch ;)',\n",

Dumplings and sushi/ sashimi are top class and the cheese grilled prawns is a family favourite. Starters make you so full that you might hv to skip the main course, because dessert section is something you cannot miss. A very good variety of pastries, ice creams and Indian sweets were on the menu. All in all, a very satiating meal.We got the early bird rates as we finished before 9pm. ',\n",
       "   u'We were 12 adults and two children at lunch on October 29 afternoon. Variety available was mind-boggling, catering to all tastes. So much good food, that even one was tempted to be a glutton ! Very polite support staff and pleasing ambience. High chairs for the children were very useful. We spent a pleasant over two hours with the family.',\n",
       "   u'Visited this place for lunch yesterday and it was an extremely mediocre affair as far as the spread and the service was concerned. The only saving grace were the ice creams. Apparently there is some renovation going on due to which a portion of the restaurant was not accessible.Ideally they should concentrate on the quality rather than the quantity. The service also needs to improve.Overall not recommended.',\n",
       "   u\"A customer went me there for dunner after a difucult day. I think it was very good choice. The place was very good. The staff was very friendly. The cocktails and the food was amazing. I can't trll you abou the prices because my customer payed the bill.\",\n",
       "   u'Its always good to celebrate at global fusion with family and friends as it offers a wide variety of buffet spread along with soft beverages and offers fabulous pan asian starters and a very good spread of mains which also has few indian mains, quality top notch. Sea food served of a good quality and prawns are bigger than the normal size thats a plus point! Desserts are the best as they have B&R counter as well and quite alot of variety in the desserts too Looking forward for my next celebration out there',\n",
       "   u\"Have been to Global Fusion some 5-6 times (once on a Sunday for brunch and rest of the time in evenings). This happens to be the safest place for me to take colleagues and family when there is a huge disparity in cuisine tastes amongst people; because Global Fusion has a great spread and literally serves almost all popular cuisines in its buffet. It has light snacks/starters for the health conscious so even better. Usually people end up stuffing themselves with starters only and have minimal main course. Great desserts counter too especially the Basking Robins counter for all kinds of ice cream flavors. The location is pretty central however parking is a little tight (a very narrow lane in the building) despite valets' availability\",\n",
       "   u'Right place to be when bidding adieu to an old employee. Bandra location is always buzzing.Oriental food lover will love this place to the fullest extent.The office group went on a buffet I believe they have ala carte menue too. Nice ambience, awesome crew and variety of dishes and drinks for all sort of people under one roof. Highly recommended to all, prior reservation is an absolute must. ',\n",
       "   u\"On top of a mall , high roof & fish pond adds to the good ambience , it is a big place but still gets crowded on weekends. They have discount if you can finish the food before 9pm . Its a buffet only restaurant. the spread is awesome.. lots of Japanese / thai type of salads , sushi's , hot starters are great , you select & its served at the table piping hot.have tempura's , good choice of seafood , if you are looking for desi indian stuff , not much. But if you up for Asian food its just great.Normally try to visit this restaurant when am in Mumbai , been here 4~5 times since I found this 2 years ago, but each time by the time I finish with salads , soup , Starters , am so full that have to skip the main curries . Dessert is ok , good array of Baskin robins icecreams.btw the food is Halal\",\n",
       "   u'Make no mistake: this is a clean and delicious space. Think about a buffet-type format. They make good food of a pretty wide variety, sushi-to-indian-to-pasta. I found it lacked a soul or personal touch, the food was decent but not spectaculary. Many dishes grade B but no dish grade A. ',\n",
       "   u'My first ever experience in the restaurant in Bandra. Firstly, the ambience, the decor take you to another world when you enter. The decor, the lake, the table set-up are all rightly done. The buffet is amazingly good with a variety of food, be it Chinese, Japanese or Indian food. Great fushion I must say. The desserts are to die for. You can take whatever you would like, no restrictions!If you are in Bandra, near linking road, Global Fushion is a place to be. A bit over-rated for their Sunday price but the food and service are amazing. But, spend a good 2-3 hours there, relishing all the food you would like to have and have a super light breakfast if you are going for a lunch ;)',\n",

If they call it a brunch, all the breakfast items were missing! No eggs, no cereal, no pancakes, and no waffles. Whoever said there is a huge spread really hasn't been to a quality brunch. Cold cuts were dumped in a corner. Salads were limp, looked dead and best not eaten. The Asian food other than dumplings was a massive disappointment. Even your favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant without a star rating will serve better food. The chat station was horrible. The person making the chat should be arrested just for not being able to make chats. The grill section had tasteless grills. They used frozen prawns. The continental food was horribly tasteless. Polenta and mashed potatoes with too much salt were inedible. A simple dish like potatoes in the jacket with cheese was bland and tasted like boiled potatoes. The Indian food was average or even less. The dal was watery and tasteless. The starters were again over salted. The desserts were a massive massive disappointment. They were not sweat and badly made. The tiramisu was a big let down. The service here was slow and average. The drinks were replaced very very slowly and we had to make repeated repeated requests. This buffet is just a waste of money and not worth even one tenth of the price they charge. The chef really needs to learn to cook and to taste it before he serves the guests. Better planning and better staff are needed here. Good quality and fresh seafood is not hard to procure in Mumbai but they serve frozen stuff!\",\n",

       " [u'My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant. I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant. They made me feel like family.If you visit the restaurant on the weekend, live music, featuring traditional Indian music, will add to your dining experience, as it did for me.',\n",
       "  u\"The food and ambience here is really nice and its a great way to experience real Indian food and at the same time make sure that you won't suffer from any stomach issues. We had the large tasting menu and all dishes were of very high quality. 1 advice: stay away from the paan (bethel leave sweet)\",\n",
       "  u'We arrived at this restaurant and were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. The service was prompt and the menu explained in detail by Azad who continued to serve us throughout the meal. The food was delicious and was served in copper plates that are traditional to the Royal classes of India. On two occasions through our very tasty meal Purvesh (the chef) came over to ask if his cooking was to our liking! Fully recommend this beautiful restaurant and special thanks to Azad and Purvesh who really went the extra mile to ensure our visit was something to remember. Absolutely brilliant. ',\n",
       "  u'Had dinner at Nawab saheb - this is an Indian restaurant located within the Renaissance Hotel at Powai. The restaurant is well furnished with tall ceilings and nice decor. They have live Indian music in the evenings with a good singer - we started our dinner at around 7 15 PM and had the restaurant and the singing all to our selves. By 8:30 the restaurant started filling up - seems to be quite popular - the food was exceptional - we went for the set meal, one Vegetarian and the other non vegetarian - this comes with a set of unlimited starters. the non vegetarian had 2 types of chicken, one fish and two lamb starters - all of them were superb. The main course was also good but we were already full with the starters. The desert options were also huge - overall a great experience with great food and soothing music. ',\n",
       "  u'The set menu is a fantastic way to experience a number of different dishes. Presented beautifully, and in a lovely environment, it was a great introduction for me to traditional North Indian dishes. I\\u2019m used to South Indian food, and was pleased to get some tips on how a couple of the fish dishes were prepared. Looking forward to another night here, for sure!',\n",
       "  u'I have visited most of the fine dine restaurants. the consistency is appreciated. Chef Younus is one of the finest chefs in the country. Kudos',\n",
       "  u\"Whenever I have a strong craving for good north indian or punjabi food, Nawab Sahab is the place I visit. It's is really disappointing to be in mumbai if you love good, spicy and rich north indian food because most of the places here are serving food with gujrati or south indian food flavours and forget authenticity, but this is one place where you feel like you are enjoying your food in Delhi restaurant. Dal Lakhani & Deserts are to die for.\",\n",
       "  u'The whole experience was royal, good ambience and enjoyed lovely live Ghazals on Saturday with Dinner booked thru Eatigo. Opted for set meals which provide a range of options from Non veg, Sea food as well as Mix and Match. The appetizers were well succulent and delicious in taste and served with a lot of interest and patience which added a notch to the eating experience. The mains were equally well prepared and went well with the garlic nans and laccha parathas. The wide desert spread had something for everyone from fresh fruits, indian sweets like gulab jamuns, ras malai and also ice cream. The staff were immaculate in their service and special thanks to \"Jayshree\" and team to help make this a memorable dining experience. Strongly recommended if you are a food lover and would like to relish a lavish indian spread + great service.',\n",

       "  u'My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant. I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant. They made me feel like family.If you visit the restaurant on the weekend, live music, featuring traditional Indian music, will add to your dining experience, as it did for me.',\n",
       "  u\"The food and ambience here is really nice and its a great way to experience real Indian food and at the same time make sure that you won't suffer from any stomach issues. We had the large tasting menu and all dishes were of very high quality. 1 advice: stay away from the paan (bethel leave sweet)\",\n",
       "  u'We arrived at this restaurant and were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. The service was prompt and the menu explained in detail by Azad who continued to serve us throughout the meal. The food was delicious and was served in copper plates that are traditional to the Royal classes of India. On two occasions through our very tasty meal Purvesh (the chef) came over to ask if his cooking was to our liking! Fully recommend this beautiful restaurant and special thanks to Azad and Purvesh who really went the extra mile to ensure our visit was something to remember. Absolutely brilliant. ',\n",
       "  u'Had dinner at Nawab saheb - this is an Indian restaurant located within the Renaissance Hotel at Powai. The restaurant is well furnished with tall ceilings and nice decor. They have live Indian music in the evenings with a good singer - we started our dinner at around 7 15 PM and had the restaurant and the singing all to our selves. By 8:30 the restaurant started filling up - seems to be quite popular - the food was exceptional - we went for the set meal, one Vegetarian and the other non vegetarian - this comes with a set of unlimited starters. the non vegetarian had 2 types of chicken, one fish and two lamb starters - all of them were superb. The main course was also good but we were already full with the starters. The desert options were also huge - overall a great experience with great food and soothing music. ',\n",
       "  u'The set menu is a fantastic way to experience a number of different dishes. Presented beautifully, and in a lovely environment, it was a great introduction for me to traditional North Indian dishes. I\\u2019m used to South Indian food, and was pleased to get some tips on how a couple of the fish dishes were prepared. Looking forward to another night here, for sure!',\n",
       "  u'I have visited most of the fine dine restaurants. the consistency is appreciated. Chef Younus is one of the finest chefs in the country. Kudos',\n",
       "  u\"Whenever I have a strong craving for good north indian or punjabi food, Nawab Sahab is the place I visit. It's is really disappointing to be in mumbai if you love good, spicy and rich north indian food because most of the places here are serving food with gujrati or south indian food flavours and forget authenticity, but this is one place where you feel like you are enjoying your food in Delhi restaurant. Dal Lakhani & Deserts are to die for.\",\n",
       "  u'The whole experience was royal, good ambience and enjoyed lovely live Ghazals on Saturday with Dinner booked thru Eatigo. Opted for set meals which provide a range of options from Non veg, Sea food as well as Mix and Match. The appetizers were well succulent and delicious in taste and served with a lot of interest and patience which added a notch to the eating experience. The mains were equally well prepared and went well with the garlic nans and laccha parathas. The wide desert spread had something for everyone from fresh fruits, indian sweets like gulab jamuns, ras malai and also ice cream. The staff were immaculate in their service and special thanks to \"Jayshree\" and team to help make this a memorable dining experience. Strongly recommended if you are a food lover and would like to relish a lavish indian spread + great service.',\n",

Then went to the spa for a great massage.We met in the lobby bar had a drink then enjoyed an Italian dinner on the top floor. The rooms were well appointed, large shower and bath tub.

       "   u\"Stayed here for 3 night's in Oct in the beach facing luxury room and this is our honest feedback for the same..Staff-lots of old faces and old guns in the armour. This hotel is a old hotel and probably believes that old is gold. Staff are friendly and helpful esp at the restaurant and the live food counters. Seen a lot of happy and smiling faces throughout our stay right from the bell desk to the housekeeper boys. 3.5/5.Rooms- neat and clean. The room was well maintained but the mattress and pillows need to be upgraded to better ones. Could have been better. The laundry service was quick and the room boys did a good job. Full marks to housekeeper boys and room cleaning. The location is a crowd puller and the view from the room is breathtaking. 4/5.Food- Delicious would be an understatement. The food looks much better than it actually tastes to tell you the truth. You really don't feel like eating it the way it's garnished.Superb! The chefs make your day in the mornings at the egg counter and dosas. Very friendly and outgoing unlike other hotels in the vicinity. Full marks to food presentation and taste. Breakfast spread the best so far we have tried in all 5 stars. Foodies paradise I must admit. 4.5/5.Cons-1) lot of noise of some civil work happening in the day time is a big put off and deprives you of good day naps. 2) Wi-Fi should be made cheap if not free. We are in the 21 century guys. 3) there should be more Jain and gluten free options in the dinner buffet. 4) no shower caps in the pool pls and no forcing business pls.not acceptable for a 5 star hotel.That's it for now till we visit you next. Keep up the efforts and looking forward to stay here again in Dec.Till then adeus.\",\n",

Visit 421 & heard how noise comes from suit room , after u get to know suggest this room to anyone or not ... ',\n",
       "   u'The stay was pleasant for the 3 nights i spent there. Check in was smooth...since there was a lack of King size bed in my category they upgraded me (with a little bit of haggling though)..The room was spacious and had all the basic amenities. Stay was comfortable. Had an access to the beach,,which was good...Pool looked good however did not use it..Breakfast was good, however felt the Dosas could have been better. Room service menu can offer a little more of variety considering what the Hotel had to offer in the other restaurant. Check out was smooth.',\n",
       "   u\"WARNING- if you are paying a security amount to this hotel be careful!!! We stayed from 26-28th September and paid 4000 INR as security. They have not returned it till now inspite of continuous follow up. They don't call back either. The hotel claims to be a 5 star only basis of being a sea side property. Rest nothing is 5 star about it. Rooms have old furniture, soggy smell & old bath fittings.Breakfast layout is decent but good quality that of a 3 star hotel. The staff asked me to pay extra for the fruit 'kiwi' when I was picking fruits from fruit basket laid out at the buffet. Wifi is chargeable only for online bookings in today's date where most bookings are online. If you directly book with the hotel it isn't! Ground staff, waiting staff is nice but managerial and above is pathetic. Not at all helpful and cooperative. To everything they had one answer- it's a policy.We travel a lot for business and leisure. This is one of the worst and the value one gets for the price is really low. Not returning there for sure. There are much better hotels. \",\n",
       "   u'I have stayed here a few times. The services and facilities were average, not bad. The location is good, which has been the prime the reason of my choice. However recently I had booked this property through a portal with a \"No Cancellation Fee\" which was to end 48 hours before arrival. Due to very inclement weather in Mumbai my meetings got cancelled and I informed the property that I will not be checking in, which I did about 36 hours before scheduled arrival. I did not want a refund. I proposed a new date where the booking could be shifted agreeing to pay any extra costs. The answer was clear \\'no\". So I was charged 2 full days (about Rs 18000) without stepping in to the property. Legally they had a right to do what they did. I thought I should put this up for those who want to go beyond just the amenities that a hotel offers',\n",
       "   u'The sea princess most fraud hotel seen in my life as they referred me to take a membership and once i got convinced as paid for my membership and there were some amenities to be given as per the mail they sent me and later they totally changed their statement..I cancelled my membership and asked for the refund so they were suppose to refund back month but they failed on their commitments and now stopped reverting back and answering calls..never seen a pathetic and unprofessional fraud hotel like this..',\n",
       "   u'Oceanic DelightsIt is one thing to look like a celebrity and just another when someone makes you feel like one! I experienced this exacting feeling at the Sea Princess Hotel, in Mumbai. I cannot thank Jerson Monterey Jack and his team enough to enliven my spirits and transport me straight to cloud nine! I started off with a \\u2018mixed berry juice\\u2019, dominated by fresh strawberries. This totally revved my spirits and I couldn\\u2019t wait to down the sumptuous spread on the buffet. The buffet imparted a global air with dishes from around the world dotting the rather enticing spread. The presentation of the salads and dessert was simply awe-inspiring. I was amazed at the creativity that was invested in each of the dishes. The flavours were authentic, and the food was fresh; and cooked to finger-licking perfection. I started off the chef\\u2019s very special, \\u2018Organic Garden Green salad\\u2019, complete with orange scented quinoa quenelles, caramelized walnuts, and herb crusted crisps. I also savoured the activated charcoal scented \\u2018Pav Bhaji Di Gaddi\\u2019 (A very rural but most cherished mixed vegetable preparation cooked in a special assortment of spices, served with bread, finely chopped onions, pomegranate seeds, and a crispy savoury snack called \\u2018Sev\\u2019. I couldn\\u2019t but marvel at the \\u2018Chemistry Lab\\u2019, a shredded chicken dish topped off with cream, and roasted on a skewer on an open fire kiln (tandoor). The biryani too was differently presented. The neatly piled rice was topped off with a patty (meat / vegetarian) and flat bread, and was completed with a \\u2018Papad\\u2019 (A crispy roasted lentil savoury, which is often preferred fried as well). The array of other dishes included the wood tossed pizzas, which a thin and crispy base, a melange of vegetables that included the famed corn and spinach mix completed in Indian spices, the \\u2018Sahi vegetable mix\\u2019 (completed in a creamy gravy), and a lot more. The list continues onward to a black lentil prep, a \\u2018Pulav\\u2019 (a vegetable and meat infused rice preparation complete with the fragrant aroma of saffron), Haka Noodles (A Chinese favourite), Ravioli (Tossed in red sauce and olives), Mixed vegetable done in hot bean sauce and shezwan, stir fried vegetables and a lot more. I also cherished the desserts that were skilfully arted to perfection. I cannot stop ranting about the delicious \\u2018Walnut Halva\\u2019 (finely grinded walnuts, tossed in clarified butter, and cooked with sugar, cardamom, and saffron), the caramel custard, enticing array of cheesecakes, fruit panacottas, some fusion desserts, and many more. What starred the show was the \\u2018Chocolate Bomb\\u2019 (another of the chef\\u2019s special) complete with a creamy cheesecake, and a whiskey caramel hot sauce, parked inside a chocolate dome. The dish delectably opens up as molten chocolate is poured onto the chocolate dome, revealing the internal goodies. The restaurant overlooks the Mumbai horizon and the beachy reserves that border the city. I caught a whiff of the upcoming winter into my hair. The Sea Princess Hotel serves as a the perfect brunch destination, frequented by the city\\u2019s celebrity circuit. Truly Chef Jerson Monterey Jack can make one feel like a star at any hour!',\n",
       "   u'SeaPrincess is an awesome choice suggested by my friend and I had lovely 2-3 business days spent at this hotel. Their rooms were clean ,staff was courteous and very hospitable environment. I would love to choose this hotel again if coming to mumbai ..Also it is a sea facing restaurant with ever lovely sea breeze on 24x7..lovely time spent ..!'],\n",

What makes it even better is that they offered us a complimentary airport pick up and drop. The check in and check out is smooth. The rooms are functional. The TV placed in the room is small but that's okay as I only needed to catch up on the news briefly in the morning. One area where Hyatt can improve significantly is hospitality. This morning, we had an early check out and hit the coffee shop for a light breakfast (fruits / muesli). Time was 6am. The breakfast officially opens at 6:30am. The staff were not the most friendly. In any other 5 star property, one can have fruits and Muesli which are already at the counter. Thankfully, the staff at the reception were surprised by this behaviour by the restaurant staff. Obviously, there is a disconnect / communication gap. I hope the hotel management fixes this. You would otherwise not want to use a hotel property which offers poor hospitality. There are just so many better options available - the Taj Santacruz is so much better with better rooms and amazing hospitality. It's located near Terminal 1. \",\n",

Being in the second floor, i had access to a business lounge, i could have my breakfast and a snack at dinner time with drinks included. Although the place was comfortable the ambient music was too loud, i had to ask to turn it down a bit. People were bringing the kids so it became noisy again. I few guests showed up in full gym gear still sweating. Not a very special hotel, just average. It needs better cleaning, odour control, noise control.Food was ok.',\n",

Also had a tough time figuring out the master switch for the room lights, eventually gave up. Maybe they can work on that.

       "   u'The Presidential suite at Hyatt Regency Mumbai, with its ultimate luxury, provides an enriching experience. I had booked the suite for a night last week, and I had a fantastic time with my family. The living room is built like a giant dome with many comfortable sofas to relax & just chill. A large tv at one corner is connected to a system with Bose speakers all over the ceiling of the dome, giving amazing auditorium like sound effects. You can connect your mobile/tablet to the system to listen to the music of your choice. A brightly-lit bar adorns one corner of the living room with all the necessary equipment, while a study table is placed at the other corner. A giant dining table with seating for 8 people is at the far end of the room. Next to the dining room is a fully-equipped kitchen. The bedroom has a king-size bed, a sofa, a tv and a recliner with 5 different massage options. The attached bathroom is big & equipped with a Jacuzzi. There are different passages which connect the living room, kitchen and bedroom. Brilliant paintings adorn the walls in all the rooms and the furniture is state-of-the-art. The only problem we faced was that the air-conditioning in the bedroom was not working properly and could not be fixed despite 2 attempts by the housekeeping staff, so we had to keep the bedroom doors open to allow the A/Cs from the living room to cool the bedroom. It was the only hitch to an otherwise perfect experience. The dinner as well as breakfast at the hotel had a big spread with cuisines from across the world. A memorable stay in the lap of luxury.'],\n",

The service standard and quality is out of this world- efficient, smooth, considerate and very professional. However there are a few things that may need improvement- A) the floors were quite noisy on account of the ongoing renovation, and also some very noisy residents who shrieked the place down at 4-5am. B) as mentioned earlier, pls introduce access control for residential floors, as presently anyone can walk up to the room in the middle of the night. ',\n",

The butler service boy was extraordinary skilled to handle all your needs and make the stay more comfortable. The inroom dining experience was something different as they serve you prompt tasty food customised same way as the chef prepares as per guided requirements. I wish to congratulate the hotel GM for best administration among other Taj I frequently stay like old heritage palace or the one with Runway view santacruj by TS & S.

       "   u'We stayed at the lands end for a staycation during the diwali week.. The staff was very hospitable but did it adhere to the Taj standards of hospitality, the answer is no.. The reason why I have loved Taj beyond all hotels is the staff of none of the other five stars could come close to Taj, however this time it felt like any other five star. Second issue was the room. We had booked a club room. The room felt outdated and like any other standard room albeit a little bigger.. Ming yang used to be my favourite Chinese restaurant in the city. However this time I felt that the quality had gone down. The positives. The view from the room was to die for.. The view from the club premiere room was outstanding (though trident in Mumbai offers the same view with better food and drinks).. The lunch buffet at Vista stood up to the high standards of Taj.. The check in an check out was smooth.. All I can say is that it is a worth it business hotel but would I indulge in another staycation here. Probably no.. ',\n",

Nephew was able to procure room thru his contact with Riddhi Chundawat, Asst Sales Manager. Professional and knowledgeable. She was itching for greener pastures and if she has flown the coop, new employer will have found a gem !!!! Everyone in Guest Services (Insha Mukri) took care of my needs. Fruits, cookies and chocolates helped late night cravings while I worked. Had to share with private driver and Aunt's housekeeper !!!! Chocolate Souffle last week was to die for !!!! Kudos to kitchen staff. Veronica and another young lady (horribly embarrassed I have forgotten her name) took care of my wake up calls. Restaurant staff during breakfast remembered my favorites. Yes, you have to tip everyone as staff survive on tips. Internet is slow so you have to work around it. Hotel is expensive but is in a secluded area yet convenient to airport. Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan live close by so expect to see tourist buses and fans from early AM till midnight hoping to see them !!!! Planning a trip again for nephew's wedding and definitely plan to stay there again.\",\n",

From outside its seem to be normal other hotels, once you inside its an amazing experience, warm welcome at the entrance, friendly and understanding staff.The room service was quite fast and it dosent make me feel like i m not comfortable, well trained staff is one of the best which i havent found in other hotels.

I stayed in a Junior suit and had the full airport service thrown in. The taxi was on time when I landed at Mumbai. The driver was presented well and spoke fluent English that help create a conversation with him. The car was very clean with refreshments. Our check in was seamless. We were escorted to our room and was shown all the facilities and the porter checked we were happy otherwise move us to something else, which I thought was very personal To end on a positive the staff at this hotel were the reason we would recommend this hotel, from the breakfast teams to business lounge workers who worked tirelessly to ensure we enjoyed every minute in the hotel.

The hotel is located in close proximity to the airport which made for a simple arrival and departure. Hotel staff were welcoming and helpful. Assistance/translating to acquire a SIM card and ordering OLA Taxis (the Indian Uber equivalent) was provided. The breakfast served on rooftop terrace were varied from day to day with traditional Indian choices, including omelettes and fresh fruit juice. The rooms are relatively spacious and clean. We felt secure and safe in this hotel.Having traveled a lot internationally this hotel may seem very basic to some western travellers. Inexpensive furnishing and finishes and some wear and tear are a part of the package. The neighbourhood is full of a population who are going about their lives. No sidewalks, crazy traffic and all sorts of bustling humanity. None of the hustling that one can experience in the Old City tourist centres of some large cities. We ate some delicious, simple vegetarian meals in unassuming nearby restaurants. Zomato is a good review app for dining options. ',\n",

The room - even though a bit small for my taste - was nicely decorated and had all the amenities one could think of. Another major advantage is that it is only 3 kms from the Airport and stone's throw from Santa Cruz (E) station and Western Expressway making it highly advantageous for Mumbai travels. The station road gives access to various shops and eating places. So you don't have to solely rely on hotel food. Easy accessibility and good rooms makes this hotel much recommended. But I would not recommend it for family stay as it is mostly frequented by business travellers and foreign tourists.\",\n",

Good size room but if you leave the aircon off for a bit you can smell a mustiness that can become overpowering.Food is great. I'm from New Zealand and found the menu to be awesome. European breakfast and dinner options available.No probs getting taxis as there is a stand outside the hotel.I stayed for a week before moving on. In summary this hotel is for the business men and woman. All the comforts and details of a tourist hotel are not here, as apparent by its proximity to the tourist hotspots.I had a good stay, but had to catch at least 4 taxis every day to get around. Not a complaint, but a tip for others (outside India)who are looking for good accomodation closer to tourist areas.\",\n",
       "   u'Comfortable place to stay and ideally located, good staff always helpful. A decent business hotel which is well maintained and is easily connected with all parts of Mumbai - near to airport, adjacent to metro station and very near to Andheri local station. Food is owsem....',\n",
       "   u'It was a nice experience staying at Residency Hotel.. recommend to my friends .. The best part is big size rooms & central AC.Very good food at comfortable rates.It is centrally located near to airport.',\n",
       "   u\"I stayed here on a business trip for three nights in May. The hotel is in easy reach of the airport and is well located for the metro and main roads too.The rooms are of a good size and clean and relatively well maintained.Breakfast was perfectly acceptable but there's not loads of variety if you're looking for something non-Indian. I love my Indian breakfasts so I was quite happy.Customer service was good and responsive. They changed my room quickly after a problem with the aircon in my room.\",\n",
       "   u'Good can turn very good n other way round it could go an average. Residency hotel is an example of how good can become an average hotel.Good location, good rooms with basic amenities, but....We were provided only 2 towels, no small or hand towel , one of the towel was over used, warn out and with hanging threads, I called up house keeping, asked to change the towel n provide hand towel, which they did promptly, later on I show extra cover on the bed was torn n had hole of more than 2 inches n so was one of pillow cover with a hole of an inch, I photographed them to show it to reception.I believe this is a regular practice, of hoteliers specially for those guests who have booked through portal, Our room was booked through \"Yatra\", last March I had similar experience, at varanasi where I was given torn n stiched towel.Next morning, complimentary breakfast was okay.All concerned hotel staff members were cooperative.',\n",

Hotel is old... rooms are done up but the age shows4. Breakfast is poor in spread and taste5. Hygiene seems to be poor.6. There are no separate tandoors for roti and non vegetarian dishes 7. Same tawa is used for vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes preparation8. Airport transfers are ridiculously expesive9. Water in tap in bathroom stinks and runs brown in colour at times10. Paid wifi is quite slowSpecial mention of Mr. Pramod at reception who took extra care to ensure my comfort during the stay.

Room is clean with a refrigerator. TV has many channels (USA & Indian). The breakfast buffet is truly wonderful (about US$35 for 5 days). I eat a huge breakfast and this lasts me until dinner. I can work very efficiently in my room. For dinner, I had fish curry and garlic nan (around US$10) and it was the nicest fish curry of my life. My waiter, Ganesh, kept getting me bits to eat from the dinner buffet while I waited for my fish curry - all without charge. I think the dinner buffet (also huge) is around US$20; I think it is probably worth it. I arrived at 4 a.m. at the International Terminal, the car sent by hotel costs me US$17 - which I thought was a little high for such a short trip. I now realize that Uber workers here. I opened Uber on my phone and everything looked perfect. So, next time, I would use Uber for transportation. I think (???) the hotel car is free if going to the domestic terminal (not sure about this). I like this hotel. I am happy here. I would definitely come back.',\n",
       "   u\"IBIS is an excellent hotel for a quick business visit. It took less than 10 mins to and from the International Airport.Unfortunately and surprisingly there is no free airport pick-up/ shuttle except from the domestic airport. The added service is about INR 1,100 (US$ 17). The Prepaid Taxi counter from the airport quoted INR 300 for air-conditioned taxi. Unfortunately, their credit card machine didn't 'connect' and I ended up going to another pre-paid taxi counter which charged INR 800 for a distance of less than 4Km!However, my disappointment was short-lived as from the hotel security at the front door onward, I could tell the service was going to be above par. The front desk was so welcoming and made sure I was properly briefed re. my facilities. So much so, the front office staff walked with me to the coffee shop and poured me a cappuccino as I had arrived on a 02:10am flight. Brilliant!The smoking room I requested was in super condition; the room was well lit, fragrant and cool with the toilet in pristine condition. The shower cubicle was spacious and immaculate to say the least.The restaurant had a decent selection for breakfast. Lunch and dinner options were good but limited to a fussy traveler like me... but hey, this is a business hotel and I was flying out in less than 24 Hrs. Didn't even have time to enjoy the comfy bed and pillows for too long in worry of missing my 11:00 am meeting and flight at 3:00am; though I managed to squeeze in 6 showers in the high pressure shower... Bliss!\",\n",
       "   u\"We stayed there after a mid night arrival at Mumbai airport. Staff is very cooperative & hotel is in great conditions with all the amenities for a short stay. Room view is not that great but you won't need to open if it is a short stay :P\",\n",
       "   u'This was the second time was staying at IBIS Mumbai airport and stay was for 5 nights on a business trip. The hotel did not disappoint - flawless & efficient rooms which you can expect in an IBIS brand. I had my business meetings in Goregaon - East and the location of this hotel is amazing, since you are going against the traffic in morning and evening, so you save on travel time. Room sizes are typical IBIS style - added to that, this is heart of Mumbai, so do not expect anything more than the basic space to move to your bed, desk and bathroom. But for a business traveller like me who left the hotel at 8 am and returned at 8pm, that was fine. The highlight of this stay was the excellent restaurant service. I reached out to Chef Rizwan at the restaurant, requesting for some home cooked, low spice food and he obliged for every single meal. Now for a frequent business traveller - that is a big big plus point to get meals which are tasty and to your palate. Thank you Chef Rizwan ! Overall a very business friendly and hassle free stay.',\n",
       "   u'A no nonsense business hotel. A comfortable yet luxurious stay. The food tastes good and the spread of the buffet is pretty decent according to the price.

Rooms are small (I had a deluxe room) and cluttered with info pamphlets, brochures and knick knacks. Even the door had 3 thick leather signs hanging from it (do not disturb, make up room, and a third sign I can\\u2019t remember) making it awkward to open the door. All this clutter seriously detracted from the peace and comfort of the stay. Bar and food are exorbitantly priced, especially for India - average quality single malt for $20.

       "   u\"My and my wife's experience of our stay at the Hotel was excellent. The services were great. The General Manager of the Hotel, Mr. Kermen Lalkaka was most helpful,and kind hearted. Not only did he upgrade to a specious suite, but also saw to it that our 54th Wedding Anniversary was duly celebrated at the Hotel. Amid the Hotel staff, special mention needs to be made of Chelsea Thakur, Guest Relations Officer, who took great care of us through out our stay, and gave us her loving helping hand whenever we needed. She deserves all the Kudos from us. She and Sudha Mehra also joined us for dinner on our wedding anniversary day, and offered us a Happy Anniversary Card, a bouquet of roses, and a cake to cut on the occasion. The three chefs, Mahesh Jadhav, Rohan Narkar, and Umesh Sawant, at the Coffee Shop served us delicious, palatable, and non-spicy dishes of our choice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner during our two nights' stay at the Hotel. Their culinary skills need to be recognized by the Hotel\",\n",

It was immaculate.Their butler service is superb and their rooms were delightful.I had a room facing the city on a high floor and it also got me access to their lounge.The breakfast is a treat with Chef Rajan an institution who wants to feed you very well with instant manoeuvres on the griddle.The hotel is well located in the mid city and good to access the airport and the commercial districts. It has several restaurants of high quality',\n",
       "   u\"I had stayed recently from 26 - 29 Oct 2017. When I arrived on 26 Oct past 11pm, there were still quite a number of staff attending to guests who have arrived late in the night. Check-in was efficient, and staff attending to me was able to retrieve my booking efficiently, and was also quick to point out that I do not have breakfast and wifi for my booking. He had then cross-sold to me the hotel's wifi & breakfast bundled package.On my final night on 28 Oct, I had met with Guest Relations Executive Shahszia Khan. She recognized me from my previous stay. I requested her to see if she could grant me an extension of check-out time as my flight on 29 Oct is only at 11pm. Shahzia was quick to offer me an extended check-out time.I greatly appreciate the service. I had managed to have a good rest before heading to the airport to catch my red-eye flight.\",\n",

Our initial room was very small for two adults and 2 children (4 and 1), however the staff promptly resolved this and gave a much larger better room.Rooms are generious size and kept to a very high standard. I could not find any fault within the rooms so though to take a wonder around the hotel whilst the wife and kids have a nap. Around the hotel there are many meeting points and rooms, obviously this is popular for businesses. The breakfast menu if 1st class, from English breakfast to Indian breakfast and eggless croissants.You cannot go wrong with the Grant Hyatt Mumbai! Nice pool and awesome staff!',\n",

       "   u\"I originally booked one of the other international hotel chain's properties near BOM but changed to this one as soon as I realized that I could get 2-way airport transfer with almost the same rate. This made things a lot easier as I did not need to deal with the complications to getting to the hotel for a short transit stay. My flight arrived late but the hotel dispatcher and driver got me to the hotel in no time. It was after midnight but the front desk got me room service in lieu of the dinner buffet. It was just what I needed as it was late. As a IHG P-member, I got an upgraded corner room which was quite big. The decor was mix of modern and local tastes and looked well maintained. Breakfast was good, but I did not remember much as I had to prepare to checkout. The front desk was well trained and showed me currency options before finalizing the paperwork. He then got me the shuttle car to T2 in just minutes. It was pouring when I checked out but I did not get a drop of rain on me before I entered T2. Overall it was a great experience.\",\n",

       "   u\"Visited mumbai on 28th-29th October 2017, booked this Hotel through booking.com, two mistakes at once. First, the site booking.com is never clear of the true prices, I ended up paying 24% GST beyond the assured LOWEST prices offered \\u1e6do me. I've been bitten twice by booking.com, first while booking my honeymoon and this was the second instance. I would suggest everyone should be aware of it!!Next the hospitality of HOTEL HOLIDAY INN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is only to SHOW that they care while they don't care at all. After we checked in, the bell boy clearly ignored to acknowledge that we had some luggage and May need help with the same, never asked if we needed any help with it. I don't want to name him here but we came across him thrice and his behaviour was same all the times.Thirdly, the hotel maybe near airport but the location was so crowded that through the window you could directly see the poorly maintained apartments with practically NOTHING else to see. I've attached a photograph. The only positive point was the location and that the rooms were clean.  I think anyone should be thinking atleast twice before booking it because there are hotels with better locations anD better value for money. \",\n",
       "   u'Fantastic welcome at this hotel! We only stayed one night but it was great. Beautiful room with many extras provided for our wedding anniversary - thank you so much.

It was really easy to get to and from the international airport from this hotel. Rooftop pool looked very inviting but we did not have time to use it unfortunately. Well done, Holiday Inn! ',\n",
       "   u'The vast lobby was very tastefully done, with walls plastered with botanical art, high chandeliers and the warm-toned lighting that adds an extra touch of luxury. We were given a room on the seventh floor, not with great views because this was an airport hotel after all, but with a comfy bed, soft carpeting, TV, writing desk and tea/coffee maker \\u2013 all in an earthy colour scheme. Our bathroom was not too bad either. The only thing missing was a balcony. After a refreshing cup of coffee, we set about exploring the hotel.Tattva spa was on the very same floor, while the fitness centre and swimming pool were on the top floor, along with a beautiful rooftop garden. The best part about the fitness centre was the view of Mumbai city with the mountains beyond. Of course, the array of fitness equipment was also impressive. In the evening, we enjoyed treatments at Tattva spa (shirodhara and potli massage). After our treatment, we made it to the rooftop right in time for sunset.We really like the space-saving concept of wall gardens, which has become popular in hotels worldwide. We wandered around admiring the flowers and views in the soothing saffron warmth of the descending sun. Late evening was the best time to take a dip in the glorious infinity pool with sweeping views of the city and mountains and miniature palms on either side.We enjoyed a scrumptious dinner and breakfast at Saptami, the all-day dining restaurant at the lobby. 72, the bar adjacent to the restaurant seemed to have many exciting offers as well.'],\n",

       "   u\"This is my first stay at a Taj property. It was highly recommended to me by a colleague, i was told to make sure that I stay in the palace wing as it is a good mix of Indian hospitality along with a regal experience of staying in a place.I have to admit, the hotel exceeded my expectations in all aspects. I stayed in the sea facing club room at the place. The room was beautiful with antique furniture, it portrayed a perfect balance of modern day living with an ancient touch of class. A special thanks to Devia who was there at the entrance to greet us. She took us straight to the room , it was my first time when i didn't have to check in at the desk, devia sent our passports to the desk while she escorted us to the room. she was very polite and extremely helpful. She made the perfect start for us. The second thing that really stood out was the amazing concierge team (dinesh, and his team) helped me arrange for a motor bike so that i could ride around mumbai and relive my old memories of the city. i have never experienced a concierge go so much out of there way in order to make the guests comfortable. i was speechless. they were professional and super polite and helpful in all aspects. amazing team. We also dined at masala craft , they had the navratari thali special going on. the food was scrumptious and Nishant at the restaurant was really helpful and knowledgeable about the food. he helped us select and the food. At breakfast you are greeted by your name and taken to the table you like. The chef went out his way and made us samosas and poha which were originally not on the menu but in order for us to enjoy our breakfast to the fullest , he went out of his way . Really heartwarming service. Overall the palace side of the property (where we stayed) was amazing. The staff goes out of their way and the hotel is mesmerising. We also tried the spa which was excellent. A really good weekend away from work. Service at Taj Mahal Palace has now got me excited about all their other properties. I know it will be tough for the other properties to match this level of service but i am sure they will surprise me once again.\",\n",

The lady who greeted us in the morning remembered our room number (Madonna) and was very warm and welcoming. Similarly, the gentleman who served us tea at the left hand side of the room (looking out of the windows) was very helpful too. A window seat in the same room was very enjoyable. However, the music was very repetitive. Rather like water torture, please change the records every day! We felt that that was a lack of staff coordination, command and control, when serving drinks food et cetera. On two or three occasions we did not get what we asked for and had to re-order. We thought that a more assertive maitre d\\u2019 type person leading the staff may be beneficial to the hotel and guests to make sure that food and drink is delivered to customers promptly. We found that that was too much artificial sent in the lobby and palace lounge, I found it rather nauseating and overpowering; less scent please. It would have been rather nice if we could have plugged in our Apple TV or other HDMI cable to watch our own programs, but this facility appears to have been disabled Overall, we had a lovely stay and would like to return again one day.If you\\u2019re looking to book this hotel, think about joining the Taj club scheme which is free.',\n",
       "   u'The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai...From check in to check out ... it\\u2019s a totally different experience all together. Great History & Great Culture. Every part & corner of this property is a master piece to enjoy & admire. It\\u2019s a Museum or an Art Gallery with a huge collection of Paintings, Old Photographs, Old Artifacts. Unmatchable Hospitality & House keeping. Here everything works perfect. Staying in Old Heritage wing ( club floor ) facing Arabian sea is an ultimate indulgence.',\n",
       "   u'This hotel is generally very good. However if you choose to stay in the tower wing and not the (more expensive) Palace wing, then you will be treated like 2nd class citizens. There was no welcoming feel and the breakfast area for us tower residents was cramped. We chose the tower wing because we preferred the modern feel, NOT because of the cost - so Taj management, please take note.',\n",
       "   u'I was there for a conference over the weekend. Scenic view of the sea from my room. Great service. Knowledgable and welcoming front desk staff.. Truly vintage feel. Extravagant rooms and food was awesome!',\n",
       "   u\"We decided to experience Taj hospitality at their flagship hotel - The Taj Mahal Palace and took a red eye flight to Mumbai. Hotel staff was very accommodating as they allowed us to check in early. We were also given an upgrade to the Palace wing which was the most beautiful part of the hotel. The location of this iconic property is very impressive and the facilities are top notch. Staff is very helpful. Even though we stayed for a night, our room was freshened up at least 4 times which is not seen at any other hotel. Due to the upgrade, we had access to the lounge which is the most expensive room in the hotel due to presence of 2 gaitonde paintings and tastefully done flooring and panelling. Health club and pool is top class and so is the pool deck area where evenings can be spent enjoying the ambience and barbeque. Amazing experience and can't wait to return again.\",\n",
       "   u'The reviews for this hotel are amazingly positive. Is this collective admiration really deserved? A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y.There is no need to further discuss the absolute beauty of this hotel, inside and outside. The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly among the top 3 hotels we have visited in more than 50 countries around the world. What really struck us during our 3-day stay is the customer service level. They could simply rely on their reputation and tourists would keep coming into the Taj no matter what. Instead they will do amazing things to push your satisfaction to new levels: personalised check-in with hotel history, calling you by your family name at the restaurant on the second day (I just don\\u2019t know how they did it), remembering how you or your wife prefer certain meals, sharing advices, tips and recommendations (where to shop and what to pay), offering complementary Indian desert, delivering top hotel car service to the airport and the list goes on and on.They certainly do not take your business for granted and I admire them for that given their leadership position in the Mumbai market. The service culture in this hotel is impeccable. Thanks to the staff (with a most special note to Beauty at the Shamania restaurant) for a most amazing stay at the Taj Mahal Palace!',\n",
       "   u'This property is little old but maintained well. Their ambiance is authentic and classic so you can just feel their history and legend even you can enjoy staying for a while in their lobby. Staffs are well trained, friendly and proper distance. It was god experience to stay this hotel.',\n",

Room was immaculate. Incredibly clean and the cleanest room I stayed in whilst travelling. Shower was basic but straightforward and got the job done. Staff offered a personal tour of Mumbai which was a nice touch. Has a rooftop common area but I didn\\u2019t see anyone else up there. ',\n",
       "   u'I stayed for 2 nights here back in October 2012. The rooms were ok, very basic and suitable for backpackers which is what I expected so nothing to complain about here. However, just to warn you not to pre-book any bus or train travel connecting in another city with these guys as I paid them to get on a bus from Delhi to Agra. The bus never turned up in the stated location in Delhi so I was left stranded in the dark morning hours and in the end, I had to hire a cab to Agra! ',\n",
       "   u'I only slept one night in this hostel but i would definitely recommend it! It is a basic hostel and I paid 700 rupees for a night in a mixed dorm. Breakfast was not included. Good wifi connection, even in my room. Location is perfect. It was closeby/ walking distance to the trainstation, markets/ bazaars, the musea and the gateway of India. It was safe to walk alone in the evening (even as single woman). The people were friendly, i was allowed to leave my luggage behind during the day, as I had an evening flight. I could even take a shower in the afternoon (after my check out). Good option to go to this hostel! ',\n",
       "   u\"This is THE place to stay at!I have never experienced a hotel with staff caring so much about their guests. They provide their guests with anything you ask for and answer any questions you have. They have tours around the city, I did the slum tour and it was an insighful and amazing experience. The staff make you feel more than welcome. The manager and his wife also working at the hotel even invited me to their house for a dinner. That's how friendly they are!!!!Top three:- Wifi! Fast and never lost its connection.- Location! The location is THE BEST. South Mumbai, but not in the crazy chaotic streets. It's calm, nice and safe. And walking distance to tourist attractions such as the gateway of india. - The room! The room is big, fresh (for being india) and really really nice! Don't miss out! Book your stay at Travellers Inn!\",\n",
       "   u'Conveniently located in Fort area.. very near to CST in case you have to catch a train from there.. it is the best place to stay.. lots of options for food nearby. taxis are easily available.

       "   u'This was my third stay at Traveller\\xb4s, for so many good reasons. The rooms are fairly priced for Mumbai, comfortingly clean and quiet (things we learned not to take for granted in hotels in India!). The location is exccellent, with the Gateway, Colaba and Churchgate within walking distance, and a great array of restaurants and shops nearby. All staff are well-mannered and professional.However, what gives Traveller\\xb4s that precious extra value is no doubt THE SERVICE. It is easy to underestimate how tricky or time-consuming getting things done can be in Mumbai if you don\\xb4t know HOW. Especially for those new to India, anything from finding a working ATM, to changing money, to getting your phone repaired or choosing a place to eat or a worthwhile tour can become a frustrating half-day wander. Managers Mohit and Neal helped us out with all this and so much more, and were happy to share their knowledge and listen to our problems. The welcoming spirit with which they do so is touching, as we discovered when Mohit invited us over to his home for the Hindu celebration of Sri Ganesh darshan (Sri Ganesh festival, end of August). Things can go quite wrong in India, and when they do it\\xb4s the quality of service that makes all the difference. We were at Traveller\\xb4s during the devastating rains that flooded and blocked all of Mumbai at the end of August. Mohit and Neal were constantly at hand, updating us and trying to help us find a way to get to the airport for our flight out, going well beyond the call of duty as we had checked out hours before. I suspect it is this mix of hard work, know-how and genuine care that has made them one of the most sought-after hostel options in Mumbai, and they well deserve it. Give them a try, I would be surprised if you were disappointed.',\n",
       "   u'1. Tryng very hard to contact them to change eaarlier booking. No results. 2.

A small outdoor play area for kids. And it is on the beach. They also offer a good brunch package where you do not need to be staying there but you can pay just for brunch and using their swimming and other facilities. It is a good option where you can spend an entire day with lot of fun. The rooms are also decent in case you wish to stay',\n",

       "   u'I had first visited The Resort 4 years ago with my husband after we had been newly married. The idea to visit again was to relive those memories but alas it was nothing like the first visit. The property is not at all maintained properly. The gardens are unkempt. The services were way way poor than what we had initially got. The price charged no where justified the service we received. Dinner at the restaurant was such a poor experience. The buffet was Rs 1400 per person but there was no one to attend to us. They were clearly short staffed. No one to clean tables or give cutlery. Many tables were just lying dirty without any one bothering to clear it. The buffet food was cold and the starter was served after 20 mins. We had to ask for everything, right from the cutlery to water and not once but 3-4 times. All this pain and we paid Rs 1400 for this. The breakfast was nothing sort of a food court. Since they did not have enough seating arrangement, people were standing and eating where ever they could find space. The total experience was so surreal, nothing close to the serenity or peace we were hoping to find. On check out time, we were called 4 times asking to check out though he had informed the first that we would be checking out at 11am. Between 10am to 11 am they called us 4 times, it felt as if they were asking us to leave immediately. All this pathetic experience at room tariff of Rs 7240. Would leave it up to you travellers to decide whether you want to shell out this kind of money for this kind of experience.',\n",
       "   u\"Unless you can't stretch your budget, this may be a place for a getaway, else the standard of management is poor. First, we had to request for change of room by the evening, as the drilling and carpentry work in the vicinity didn't stop. No concern for the guests staying. The quality of food is just average, including the breakfast. The breakfast on Sunday was another disappointment, there was a huge crowd maybe due to the weekend. It was task getting a table, getting hold of cutlery was another fight. The noise in the restaurant was beyond constant comfort and the quality of food again being very average. The plus points are the location, the big size swimming pool and the view of the sea from the property. \"],\n",
