"Iâ€™ve stayed here twice in the past two months on my visit to Mumbai. Quintessential Taj Hospitality!! The hotel is spacious with a lot of space to walk around, eating options many, rooms are spacious and well maintained, views from the room are mind blowing. The service standard and quality is out of this world- efficient, smooth, considerate and very professional. However there are a few things that may need improvement- A) the floors were quite noisy on account of the ongoing renovation, and also some very noisy residents who shrieked the place down at 4-5am. B) as mentioned earlier, pls introduce access control for residential floors, as presently anyone can walk up to the room in the middle of the night. ","I was expecting a bit normal old property, but once inside the lobby it was an amazing impression. The staff at front desk is quite friendly and understand all your needs. My suite room facing sea had a wonderful view. The rooms are very well furnished full of all required amenities. The housekeeping staff of hotel is ever ready to meet all requirements instantly. The butler service boy was extraordinary skilled to handle all your needs and make the stay more comfortable. The inroom dining experience was something different as they serve you prompt tasty food customised same way as the chef prepares as per guided requirements. I wish to congratulate the hotel GM for best administration among other Taj I frequently stay like old heritage palace or the one with Runway view santacruj by TS & S. The club lounge at 21 level has wonderful view and well equipped. The entire hotel staff is very friendly & cooprative. Still I think I forget to comment any area","We stayed at the lands end for a staycation during the diwali week.. The staff was very hospitable but did it adhere to the Taj standards of hospitality, the answer is no.. The reason why I have loved Taj beyond all hotels is the staff of none of the other five stars could come close to Taj, however this time it felt like any other five star. Second issue was the room. We had booked a club room. The room felt outdated and like any other standard room albeit a little bigger.. Ming yang used to be my favourite Chinese restaurant in the city. However this time I felt that the quality had gone down. The positives. The view from the room was to die for.. The view from the club premiere room was outstanding (though trident in Mumbai offers the same view with better food and drinks).. The lunch buffet at Vista stood up to the high standards of Taj.. The check in an check out was smooth.. All I can say is that it is a worth it business hotel but would I indulge in another staycation here. Probably no.. ","The venue by the bay is really exotic..
Get a sea facing room and watch the waves..
Rooms are neat and bathrooms are excellently decorated and spotless..
Food quality, service and hospitality is good..
Really enjoyed my stay..",Facing Arabian Sea this luxury hotel is one of the oldest properties of taj hotels in Mumbai. Very spacious lobby and attractive restaurants. Food is delicious. Try fish curry with steamed rice and rasmalai.,"We were recently at the Taj Lands End in Bandra, Maharashtra in India and cannot tell you how amazing of a hotel it is. The staff was very friendly the check in was smooth and quick. They have an amazing bar/lounge in the hotel which we took to as out local. Even though the hotel is old it feels so luxurious inside the rooms were big and packed with amenities and all modern furniture & fixtures. The pool is good however could do with an upgrade at the poolside bar. All in all its such a nice hotel with the shopping district of linking road only a few minutes by Rickshaw away. Highly recommended for families and couples","I just want to share my stay at Taj . This was an unforgettable experience and I would highly recommended Taj to all my friends and family. You have the most friendly and very helpful staffs, they never hesitate for one minute to do anything and they are forever ready to help, there is absolutely nothing that I can say was not good at Taj. Thank you Shivi Tandoon for being such a great host starting from check in until check out she made us feel that we are just in our own country. Food was amazing such a wide variety and the service in the restaurant was excellent. I will for sure visit again and recommend Taj to all my families and friends","Extended stay from Dec 22, 2016 thru Feb 7, 2017. Very nice quiet location. Room with ocean view was fantastic. Luxurious and spacious - bedroom/bathroom with shower/tub. Nephew was able to procure room thru his contact with Riddhi Chundawat, Asst Sales Manager. Professional and knowledgeable. She was itching for greener pastures and if she has flown the coop, new employer will have found a gem !!!! Everyone in Guest Services (Insha Mukri) took care of my needs. Fruits, cookies and chocolates helped late night cravings while I worked. Had to share with private driver and Aunt's housekeeper !!!! Chocolate Souffle last week was to die for !!!! Kudos to kitchen staff. Veronica and another young lady (horribly embarrassed I have forgotten her name) took care of my wake up calls. Restaurant staff during breakfast remembered my favorites. Yes, you have to tip everyone as staff survive on tips. Internet is slow so you have to work around it. Hotel is expensive but is in a secluded area yet convenient to airport. Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan live close by so expect to see tourist buses and fans from early AM till midnight hoping to see them !!!! Planning a trip again for nephew's wedding and definitely plan to stay there again.","No words.... Taj Lands End is one of the best hotels in the Mumbai suburbs. From outside its seem to be normal other hotels, once you inside its an amazing experience, warm welcome at the entrance, friendly and understanding staff.The room service was quite fast and it dosent make me feel like i m not comfortable, well trained staff is one of the best which i havent found in other hotels. The didning experience and quick food service by chef its impressive.I personally recommend if you want to stay a hotel. dont miss this one It has great connectivity to the business hubs and international airport and many parts of the city","Excellent location (I've always gotten to enjoy great sea views here) in Mumbai's charming (and trendy) neighborhood of Bandra. This was my third stay here over a two year-period, and the experience has been consistently great. Let's not forget the staff of the hotel, especially at the reception. Everything from arrival till departure was excellent as expected."
