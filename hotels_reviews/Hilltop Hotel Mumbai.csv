Very good place to stay near Worli sea face and sea link. Food is good and nice ambience. You get the real feel of Mumbai while staying here. Neat and clean hotel. Just close to the posh locality of Worli. Also a good place to stay with family. ,"A budget hotel, location is its only usp. it's located barely 40 - 50 meters from Worli seaface, close to the worli end of Bandra - Worli sea link. If you want to stay in south Mumbai, close to the sea, but, at the same time be close to the airport, you might consider this hotel.Lobby isn't very expansive, & houses their only restaurant.As one steps out of the elevator, the first thing that strikes you odd, is narrow and serpentine corridor (barely 3 feet wide, turning at right angle every 10 feet).Rooms are adequate in size, but poor in layout. Only a side table separated the head end of our bed from bathroom door. Rooms have all the modern amenities i.e. split ac, lcd tv, mini bar, travel desk, and cupboard. Windows can be opened (what a rarity, but this is one thing I liked the most).Bathrooms are horrible to say the least. Small in size, but with the shower area so narrow (barely 1 and half feet wide), it would barely accommodate a moderate sized person. on top of it, the shower area is barricaded from rest of the bathroom with a glass partition, without a handle bar, making it an area prone to falls.They have a restaurant (located in the lobby itself), as well as in room dining facility. Restaurant only serves buffet, mainly indian dishes & has limited menu, In room dining gives more options.Parking is small, enough for 4- 5 vehicles.Choose it, if you want to stay at worli sea face.","Had booked a standard room for a colleague who was coming to Mumbai. The room is so small that there is no place to even walk around the bed. For the price, this place is best avoided. The only good part is the location - plenty of better hotels available at this price","Excellent location at sea face, Worli with good service. You can go for a walk in evening & morning at sea face which is just 2 minutes distance from hotel. You can also have a view of sea link. Beautiful view of sea link at night specially with many cars moving on the bridge.","Good Hotel at good location.Walk able Distance approx 100 meters to enjoy cool sea breezeFood quality was very good, Good Room Service & Nice roomsJust one thing that staff on reception was not aware that they should talk with politeness which was missing.Wi-fi was not working i had a talk with reception on the phone and to my surprise the reception guy behaved like as if i am staying free there. Otherwise everything was good.","A well laid out hotel ,with good rooms and service, the highlight is the sea view from the top floors.the close vicnty to worli sea face is a plus. The Coffee shop is decent and the rates at the Hotel are decent .","Good hotel , value for money, walking distance to Worli sea link view and joggers paradise ! Good could have been better and the hotel galleries junked with extra beds and laundry which should be removed to keep the approach clean ! Staff are good except for the restaurant , some old lots were rude , need to retrained on courtesies and customer delight ! Overall worth the money !",I had been looking for a hotel near the wedding banquets and this was a bang on place for us. The Staff is very co operative specially the Manager (Fernandes Sir). He offered us the best deal he could. This hotel was the only hotel who could give us 30 rooms at one place as we had lot of people to accomodate. Cherry on the top was the newly made banquets which made our guest just so comfortable. Special care was taken for our food since we didnt want any Non Veg hand to go in it and yes they did take personal care of it. The food served was so amazing that our guests still remember the stay. Overall great experience i would saurely recomend people to go there and stay even just for leisure..!!!!Thank you all people connected with Hiltop...for making my sister's wedding a grand success..!!!,"Stay was pleasant. Comfortable. Staff is prompt n co operative.
