Rahul Oak and Rahul deshpande are organisers and extremely rude. Never ever go to this place. Rooms are shabby. When asked for a bowl during lunch it was denied. When asked for a tyre for a kid in pool it was asked to pay Rs 200. When asked for a bat it was asked to pay Rs 500 as deposit. No drinking bottle was also provided.,An average place. Add to that foul smell of fishes from nearby beach and your thoughts of relaxing get ruined. Maybe I am biased because I am a vegetarian. I did find some people enjoying the sea food to their heart here!,"Pali Beach Resort is my all-time favourite.The rates as compared is more economical and it assures the best services. The food is okay. There are two types of pool. The smaller one needs a little maintenance but the larger pool is awesome! It is little deep however, the beginners can enjoy at the start as it is not that deep. Some of the waterslides are not functional but who cares! All you need to do just dance and dance on the music as there's a DJ! Deluxe and Senior Deluxe are very nice and cozy. The washroom might need little maintenance. The standard rooms are also okay, for a better experience of the ambiance, try senior deluxe! The staffs are very very helpful right from the reception to the housekeeping. It is and will be one of my favourite resort all time!","Best place for couples to visit. The food provided by the hotel was awesome as well as it was delivered on time, no delay in delivering food or any other thing. If you are wishing to go with your family, friends or your loved ones then feel free to visit Pali Beach Resort. A place which i can recommend to many",Worst experience....it as my baby's first birthday... They charged for everything but nothing was good as expected...
