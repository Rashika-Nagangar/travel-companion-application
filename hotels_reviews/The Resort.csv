Thank you hospitality team for making our stay so memorable and comfortable. Must say the property is beautifully maintained and the staff is very courteous. If you are planning to go for a family outing this will be the best resort to visit.,"A perfect place for relaxation. Good food and services. Their sea view rooms have beautiful balcony sit-outs overlooking the pool as well as the Arabian sea, luxurious bath tub in the suite, and huge comfortable beds. Their truly de-stressing spa creates a tempting plan for a relaxed weekend that's not away from the city. Their courteous and polite staff helped me set up a nice pre-birthday surprise for my sister.",It has an awesome ambience with the best service and the food is also relishing....the interior is classy and elegant and has an amazing pool side restaurant...commendable work by Valerian and other staff...had an amazing time...,Excellent Ambience. Very good rooms facing the beach. Excellent food. Staff is very polite and courteous. A very nice place to spend a day. Having a repeat value. Mr Valerian Restaurant Manager is very helpful and courteous. Very spacious restaurant..new buffet counter...excellently renovated...lots of counter with multiple cuisine... we have revisited after 9month's as it was under rennovation....just loved it...,The resort is a resort that has come to our rescue every time we are bored to plan a weekend. The resort is right in the city but as it is in a little interiors it gives you a holiday feel. As it is a very old resort now the interiors look a little old. But they have good swimming pool. A small outdoor play area for kids. And it is on the beach. They also offer a good brunch package where you do not need to be staying there but you can pay just for brunch and using their swimming and other facilities. It is a good option where you can spend an entire day with lot of fun. The rooms are also decent in case you wish to stay,"we visited during Diwali days, it was an excellent holiday. being busy at the counter we were given check in really fast, sea and pool facing room. Breakfast spread was very good and food was also tasty. we found alacarte to be little overpriced. overall a very nice holiday. Charisma gave me a good deal and the staff and service were good.thanks.","I had first visited The Resort 4 years ago with my husband after we had been newly married. The idea to visit again was to relive those memories but alas it was nothing like the first visit. The property is not at all maintained properly. The gardens are unkempt. The services were way way poor than what we had initially got. The price charged no where justified the service we received. Dinner at the restaurant was such a poor experience. The buffet was Rs 1400 per person but there was no one to attend to us. They were clearly short staffed. No one to clean tables or give cutlery. Many tables were just lying dirty without any one bothering to clear it. The buffet food was cold and the starter was served after 20 mins. We had to ask for everything, right from the cutlery to water and not once but 3-4 times. All this pain and we paid Rs 1400 for this. The breakfast was nothing sort of a food court. Since they did not have enough seating arrangement, people were standing and eating where ever they could find space. The total experience was so surreal, nothing close to the serenity or peace we were hoping to find. On check out time, we were called 4 times asking to check out though he had informed the first that we would be checking out at 11am. Between 10am to 11 am they called us 4 times, it felt as if they were asking us to leave immediately. All this pathetic experience at room tariff of Rs 7240. Would leave it up to you travellers to decide whether you want to shell out this kind of money for this kind of experience.","Unless you can't stretch your budget, this may be a place for a getaway, else the standard of management is poor. First, we had to request for change of room by the evening, as the drilling and carpentry work in the vicinity didn't stop. No concern for the guests staying. The quality of food is just average, including the breakfast. The breakfast on Sunday was another disappointment, there was a huge crowd maybe due to the weekend. It was task getting a table, getting hold of cutlery was another fight. The noise in the restaurant was beyond constant comfort and the quality of food again being very average. The plus points are the location, the big size swimming pool and the view of the sea from the property. "
