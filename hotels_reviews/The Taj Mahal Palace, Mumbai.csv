"After a long trip from south India ,to stay in this hotel on the front of Gate of India becomes dream.Excellent services for all, tasty food, no quantities limits, they upgrade us ,because we use to stay in Taj Hotels, with a four room suite with dedicate buttler, and a lot of other small attentions.Congrats to this management","This is my first stay at a Taj property. It was highly recommended to me by a colleague, i was told to make sure that I stay in the palace wing as it is a good mix of Indian hospitality along with a regal experience of staying in a place.I have to admit, the hotel exceeded my expectations in all aspects. I stayed in the sea facing club room at the place. The room was beautiful with antique furniture, it portrayed a perfect balance of modern day living with an ancient touch of class. A special thanks to Devia who was there at the entrance to greet us. She took us straight to the room , it was my first time when i didn't have to check in at the desk, devia sent our passports to the desk while she escorted us to the room. she was very polite and extremely helpful. She made the perfect start for us. The second thing that really stood out was the amazing concierge team (dinesh, and his team) helped me arrange for a motor bike so that i could ride around mumbai and relive my old memories of the city. i have never experienced a concierge go so much out of there way in order to make the guests comfortable. i was speechless. they were professional and super polite and helpful in all aspects. amazing team. We also dined at masala craft , they had the navratari thali special going on. the food was scrumptious and Nishant at the restaurant was really helpful and knowledgeable about the food. he helped us select and the food. At breakfast you are greeted by your name and taken to the table you like. The chef went out his way and made us samosas and poha which were originally not on the menu but in order for us to enjoy our breakfast to the fullest , he went out of his way . Really heartwarming service. Overall the palace side of the property (where we stayed) was amazing. The staff goes out of their way and the hotel is mesmerising. We also tried the spa which was excellent. A really good weekend away from work. Service at Taj Mahal Palace has now got me excited about all their other properties. I know it will be tough for the other properties to match this level of service but i am sure they will surprise me once again.","And enjoyable stay. The room was immaculately kept. We really enjoyed the luxuary of Ploh Bath robes . The pool was a lovely temperature and the staff, including the changing room staff were very good.We enjoyed the afternoon teas and evening drinks, made available to club members.  The cleaning and floor staff on fifth floor were excellent. They were very polite to customers, even standing aside to let customers pass, a very nice touch. Breakfasts were excellent, there was a good range of different food types to suit all pallets. The pastries and cakes were beautiful. The lady who greeted us in the morning remembered our room number (Madonna) and was very warm and welcoming. Similarly, the gentleman who served us tea at the left hand side of the room (looking out of the windows) was very helpful too. A window seat in the same room was very enjoyable. However, the music was very repetitive. Rather like water torture, please change the records every day! We felt that that was a lack of staff coordination, command and control, when serving drinks food et cetera. On two or three occasions we did not get what we asked for and had to re-order. We thought that a more assertive maitre d’ type person leading the staff may be beneficial to the hotel and guests to make sure that food and drink is delivered to customers promptly. We found that that was too much artificial sent in the lobby and palace lounge, I found it rather nauseating and overpowering; less scent please. It would have been rather nice if we could have plugged in our Apple TV or other HDMI cable to watch our own programs, but this facility appears to have been disabled Overall, we had a lovely stay and would like to return again one day.If you’re looking to book this hotel, think about joining the Taj club scheme which is free.","The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai...From check in to check out ... it’s a totally different experience all together. Great History & Great Culture. Every part & corner of this property is a master piece to enjoy & admire. It’s a Museum or an Art Gallery with a huge collection of Paintings, Old Photographs, Old Artifacts. Unmatchable Hospitality & House keeping. Here everything works perfect. Staying in Old Heritage wing ( club floor ) facing Arabian sea is an ultimate indulgence.","This hotel is generally very good. However if you choose to stay in the tower wing and not the (more expensive) Palace wing, then you will be treated like 2nd class citizens. There was no welcoming feel and the breakfast area for us tower residents was cramped. We chose the tower wing because we preferred the modern feel, NOT because of the cost - so Taj management, please take note.",I was there for a conference over the weekend. Scenic view of the sea from my room. Great service. Knowledgable and welcoming front desk staff.. Truly vintage feel. Extravagant rooms and food was awesome!,"We decided to experience Taj hospitality at their flagship hotel - The Taj Mahal Palace and took a red eye flight to Mumbai. Hotel staff was very accommodating as they allowed us to check in early. We were also given an upgrade to the Palace wing which was the most beautiful part of the hotel. The location of this iconic property is very impressive and the facilities are top notch. Staff is very helpful. Even though we stayed for a night, our room was freshened up at least 4 times which is not seen at any other hotel. Due to the upgrade, we had access to the lounge which is the most expensive room in the hotel due to presence of 2 gaitonde paintings and tastefully done flooring and panelling. Health club and pool is top class and so is the pool deck area where evenings can be spent enjoying the ambience and barbeque. Amazing experience and can't wait to return again.","The reviews for this hotel are amazingly positive. Is this collective admiration really deserved? A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y.There is no need to further discuss the absolute beauty of this hotel, inside and outside. The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly among the top 3 hotels we have visited in more than 50 countries around the world. What really struck us during our 3-day stay is the customer service level. They could simply rely on their reputation and tourists would keep coming into the Taj no matter what. Instead they will do amazing things to push your satisfaction to new levels: personalised check-in with hotel history, calling you by your family name at the restaurant on the second day (I just don’t know how they did it), remembering how you or your wife prefer certain meals, sharing advices, tips and recommendations (where to shop and what to pay), offering complementary Indian desert, delivering top hotel car service to the airport and the list goes on and on.They certainly do not take your business for granted and I admire them for that given their leadership position in the Mumbai market. The service culture in this hotel is impeccable. Thanks to the staff (with a most special note to Beauty at the Shamania restaurant) for a most amazing stay at the Taj Mahal Palace!","This property is little old but maintained well. Their ambiance is authentic and classic so you can just feel their history and legend even you can enjoy staying for a while in their lobby. Staffs are well trained, friendly and proper distance. It was god experience to stay this hotel.","We are lucky to have styed her befor a couple of years ago, but what can i say?! still perfection.The Palacee wing is amazing and being welcomed with red roses by the wondrrful manager Ramneet Singh was very special :) Cant wait to come back again!"
