Came here due to a business trip for 4 days!The security and safety of the hotel was great butler service on my floor was top!The staff was all trying their best to please and provide their best service and of course me typical Singaporean must lower my expectation of their efficiency.But nevertheless I am impressed with the cleanliness and service of the hotel which I didn't least expect it!Overall thumbs up!!,"I am a frequent traveller having the opportunity to visit mumbai repeatedly every year this October was back at the oberoi mumbai at nariman point and like every time this was a fantastic experience, bespoke rooms, world class amenities an ambience par excellence gourmet cuisine and avant garde service would go no where else to stay the staff makes you feel very special I have stayed in some of the world finest hotels but this one is over the top Abhijat sharma","We had a very enjoyable one night stay at the Oberoi. We had a premium sea view room which had a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea and city, and an extremely comfy bed (and pillow menu). The rooms are relatively small in comparison with other places we stayed in India and the breakfast buffet could have had a little more choice.During our stay, we booked a Heritage walk through the hotel and our guide was Laxmi. The walk was definitely worth it and Laxmi was a wonderful guide - very knowledgable, friendly and went out of her way to give us a flavour of Mumbai in the short amount of time we had.","The promise of a Swachh Bharat still needs some work to be implemented but the Oberoi is way ahead! It is a wonderful, good smelling, shining environment with lovely staff and good equipment. As we were travelling with our baby, we indulged in the excellent (and also expensive) in-room dining every night. Fantastic food! They brought us napkins with the name of our daughter stitched upon. How sweet was that. A fantastic hotel experience - it was worth it!","Everything about our stay was excellent - the service, food (a good choice of restaurants), bedroom & bathroom and pool area. Great location and safe to wander around. I cant fault anything and would definitely recommend it.","As one of most legendary hotel in Bombay, everything was well organized. I liked contagious and friendly staffs.
Also they have nice restaurants. We tried their Italian restaurant, they served proper Italian cuisine especially I loved their risotto.","From the time I arrived until i left I felt very welcome the staff were superb the whole vibe of the hotel is so friendly i can not wait to stay there again.The food was terrific with so many choices, there was not one thing that was not fantastic here.","Stayed in Delhi and Mumbai in oct 2017 with my family very good services staff are very helpful and very kind breakfast and dinner was unforgettable.Rooms well appointed,clean and spot on in Mumbai very good sea view. Looking forward to go back in future highly recommended.","I have stayed at Oberoi hotels in several other cities. This one is trying hard to please but not yet up to the standard of the others. Staff try hard to serve, but one can see it is a bit forced as though they are being measured on it. In fact they seem a bit stressed. Rooms are small (I had a deluxe room) and cluttered with info pamphlets, brochures and knick knacks. Even the door had 3 thick leather signs hanging from it (do not disturb, make up room, and a third sign I canâ€™t remember) making it awkward to open the door. All this clutter seriously detracted from the peace and comfort of the stay. Bar and food are exorbitantly priced, especially for India - average quality single malt for $20. I like the Oberoi chain, but this one falls short. ","A regular guest in your hotel as part of BCCI or Star broadcasting crew, I recently visited again during the India Australia cricket series.As always, service was refreshingly awesome, staff was cordial and food was delicious. Your front desk staff is one of the best I have met, and I'm sure you guys have handpicked some of the best people for the job. Also, as special mention, your Gym trainer Aishwary helped me get rid of a nagging lower back pain that was refusing to go since September last week. His specially designed stretching exercises helped me get back to normal in a space of 2 days. He's truly a savior!!All in all, a truly wonderful experience again!"
