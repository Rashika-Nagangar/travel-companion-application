Fantastic...great room... excellent staff...room service food was very good! ....All the amenities were excellent...no complaints...Very busy check in. my only complaint was that it is about an hour away from the airport.,"One of the best hotel near Nariman Point area... lovely deluxe rooms with best service , view also awesome...I like rooms over here.. it was very nice ... frangipani is amazing place in trident... must visit","The hotel is a landmark of sorts, sitting right at the end of Marine Drive at Nariman Point. Its conveniently located in the south, and has a friendly warm staff. The hotel itself is in need of an renovation / overhaul, since the age shows through in the rooms / bath rooms and public areas though it is well maintained and clean. Breakfast can get crowded, due to the sheer number of guests and rooms in the hotel, but once you get the table, the food is just fine. Staff is courteous and the service good.",We had an awesome stay at the Trident. The staff in every department are courteous and always ready to go that extra mile. The breakfast was sumptuous!My son loved the courtesy drop in the Mini Cooper.Thanks for making our Mumbai trip such a memorable one!,It is an amazing place ! The staff here is good and food also tastes delicious. :)Pool is situated at a beautiful place where you can just relax and enjoy the scene of entire Marine Lines. Helpful staff with and good security!,"Beautiful place to stay at Mumbai...prime location. Just walk out to marine drive at any part of the day. Most of the important landmarks and visiting sites are within walking distance. Front line even number rooms give a great sea side view, Food has been delicious catering for everyone's taste buds. Lifts appear to be in less than adequate numbers....waiting time may be prolonged at time. Rooms do not have electric iron and iron boards....may not be available when you need them the most.Overall a good experience....will be excellent if these problems are rectified.","This is an excellent hotel. The rooms are beautiful with everything you need. All the staff are most helpful ,it's has a calm atmosphere in the middle of Mumbai. There was a good selection for breakfast with fruit ,omelette pancakes cereal as well as hot buffet with both European and Indian food to choose from. Would highly recommend.","We had been gone to trident nariman point mumbai on the special occassion of my fatgers birthday and we also got to meet cricket stars and we had celebrated the fathers birthday at best. The hotel along with restaurant indiana jones made it just awesome they had given us cake in a surprise way. I would like to thank deepali mathur(duty manager), hoosang(concierge), cyrus(gym trainer) & krutika(staff membe). The chef Jitu Phukan of the indiana jones restaurant and sanket (staff member) . They all cooperate with us and also helped us in many ways.","We stayed one night here as part of a Gate 1 tour group. Excellent hotel, with great service. Nice large rooms, quiet, with excellent wifi. We had a group dinner in the hotel and after two weeks touring all over India it was the best food we had. The chefs do an excellent job. As we had an early flight to Nepal the hotel created a breakfast box for us to take away. Fabulous service. Wifi was free and good as well.",Very good hotel.Location is awesome and the staff are brilliant.you only appreciate the Indian hospitality after you travel to hong kong and china.any way overall good hotel.Keep it up.Breakfast was also very good.
