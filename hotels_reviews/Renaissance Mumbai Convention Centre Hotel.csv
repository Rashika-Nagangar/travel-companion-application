"The hotel is in a nice and quiet area of Mumbai but yet close to the city and rooms are nice (great upgrades for Platinum). Quite impressed with the lounge that serves nice food, drinks for long hours and most notable the great staff members from Kamlesh, Satish, and Shrikant who has every evening made the environment of the lounge comfortable with great service at the perfect level for most business and holiday travelers after a long long busy day. And special thanks to Chef Chandras for his personal visits to guests and offering special pasta (on Halloween night) as well as dessert after drinks. Great job and looking forward to coming back on my next stay!!",We decided to go for a dinner buffet based upon the reviews written on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. The location is very good and with beautiful lake views and pleasant outdoor area which is well maintained. The service was excellent. Santosh and Kaustubh were attentive to our needs and were very knowledgeable and along with other staff we had a very memorable dinning experience. We will recommend to all our friends about this undiscovered gem in Mumbai suburbs.,Mr. Vitthal rathod good job for a guest n nice services last 3 years .belldex for a good job for his services nice nature n good for a job nice n he always ready to guest services good appriance for a guest,Luxurious hotel located beside Powai Lake. Location is near to the airport but isolated. Hotel room is large though furniture and design looks outdated. Full amenities are available. Water pressure of shower is strong. Breakfast spread is great. Internet WiFi is strong and fast. Service staffs are helpful.,"The hotel is a large resort located in the sylvan surroundings of Powai Lake, in suburban Mumbai. Spent 2 days there - overall the hotel is a superbly furnished 5 star hotel - Great Indian touches to the furnishing - Lobby is superb with Italian marble walls.Breakfast at Fratelli was a huge spread - the largest i have ever seen. Live counters for Indian foods like Parathas, Dosas as well as the usual egg counter. The room we got was a lake facing one with superb views of the the lake and the city beyond.As a gold member i had access to the executive lounge on the 36th floor - the service levels there were exceptional - special mention to Kamlesh and Chadrahas for the warmth and hospitality shown to us. The hotel has a nice pool overlooking the lake. Fitness facilities are very good. I believe the spa is great as well though i did not use it. There are 3-4 restaurants in house all of which have good reviews. We had dinner at Nawab Saheb, the Indian restaurant which was superb, with live Indian music. Overall it was a great experience and would love to stay there again.",Was AMAZING.... you can't make ...you at centre of mumbai... still felt like away from mumbai..... total isolation from hussle bussle of mumbai..god bless them all ...they are indeed an profesional team to be with..,"This place is no less than your luxury trip to the seas. A great view, amaizng staff, well designed rooms and suites. They have it all. I love the setting and ambiance here. A few days it gets difficult due to the large number of events that they organize. But then it adds to some glamour and vibrancy.","My family was at Renaissance Powai, for 4 days including weekend for rest and relax.We had booked a suit and premier room. Very warm and pleasant service at Executive lounge by Chandrahas, Satish , Shrikant and Kamlesh.They took care of my son well.Overall great experience at Renaissance.","Have been visiting Rennaissance for over 14 years and have loved their breads and desserts, specially the fluffy croissants. We eat them and compliment the person attending to us never thinking about the people who baked them. But this time I decided to meet the people who work all night to make those lovely croissants available to us for breakfast. I was met by an energetic team of young chefs, sweet like their desserts, a bubbly yet efficient lot with an awesome sense of humour and commitment to their work. You will never get to see them while you dine coz theyâ€™re so busy in their kitchen rolling out doughs, tempering their chocolates, whipping the cream or stacking the layers of yet another sweet invention of theirs. Would like to commend the entire team who I had the privilege of meeting and even learning a few baking skills. Beginning with Chef Jawed who was kind and benevolent to allow me to visit their bakery. Chefs and team members Gervin, Vikram, Akhil, Aparna, Kshitij, Ghandali, Merlyn and Emanuel. Wishing them the very best and I hope that more people acknowledge the work of the people behind the scenes.",The breakfast spread was fantastic in a fact better than renaissance mumbai .One of the best i have a had in five star restaurant fratelli fresh (i highly recommend not to miss the Breakfast with keshav abcg juice here.)Morning Breakfast was awesome.Thank you. Will surely visit again in next trip.
