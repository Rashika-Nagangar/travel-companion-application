"Great service. We (traveling with a colleague) arrived late night and the service was impeccable, thoughtful - thanks Aniketh! He went above and beyond ! JW !Food was great! JW juhu is really a nice time ! Check it out ","Jwcafe is greatand room are nice, sadly i don’t get smoking room so my suggestion is please add more smoking rooms ✌️After few days in Mumbai I think this is the best place around the airport ",Amazing hotel with the most attentive staff I have seen in a long time. Everything was flawless and I can only recommend this hotel. Especially I was very impressed with the quality of the room and the efforts put in by the staff to make my stay special.,"We were travelling with a 10 Month baby and they have been so accommodating. They did fresh baby food on demand, warm it round the clock , give us everything we need to be sure that we were confortable with the baby. The swimming pool is great and enjoyable at the end of a busy day. The food delicious and a lot of choices in the buffet. The rooms have everything you will expect from this category.I would definitely recommend the place and will come back! ",Really good stay here. Staff are amazing. Special thank to Saif and Jigyasa at the reception. They were really helpful and check in was great - upgraded us to a room with a better view. Very clean facility. Breakfast was amazing with lots of variety and vegetarian options. Excellent gym and although we did not get a chance to use pool area it looked really good. ,"The property is old, but the rooms are nicely revamped. Nice. The best part is the legendary service provided to its guests. Somehow, they are able to remember who you are. I am addressed my name (even though I am an ordinary member of the Marriott program). How they do this is beyond me. It goes to show the dedication in their service. At breakfast when dining alone, the service staff frequently comes over to ask how they can assist further. I have never felt so ‘pampered’ in my life. Indeed the service level is legendary. They are doing everything right at JW Marriott Juhu. Kudos, I will definitely be back here! ","My daughter and I stayed a week from 22 October and we were so happy that we chose this hotel. The staff are just so wonderful there. Chefs Mr Mehta and Mr Nishad fed us wonderful dishes and were only to eager to please us. Rupesh from Lotus Café served us daily with a smile. Ms Swati made our checkout very easy, efficient and painless. I have to mention Michael from the executive lounge who excelled in customer service. Nothing was difficult for him to handle. He was just exceptional. Thank you. Definitely will return to this hotel.",I have been here for team dinner. The infrastructure is good. Great hospitality. Not a place if you are fond of Indian food however you get almost all other type of cuisines. Delicious fruits and deserts add charm to the beautiful ambience,"I have stayed at this hotel several times on professional trips and those stays were many years back. I remember that even then this hotel was well managed and an excellent place to stay. I stayed in this hotel now after a long gap and that too with my family (though only for one night). It was a delight to find the hotel as good as before! Hotel lobby and surrounding area are exceptional and one feels openness as distinct advantage of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed and many rooms have excellent views of the sea. Service and hospitality in the hotel is remarkable.Lotus Cafe is picturesque with beautiful views. Breakfast is truly a treat. Several varieties, good choice of food items, and personalised service. Restaurant managers, chefs, and sous chef make it a point to meet most guests and engage with them in positive manner. One gets the feeling that they truly care and want to serve with great attention and customised service. Quality of food is very good and this restaurant is a must visit for guests staying in this hotel.Executive Lounge in the hotel is another place that is so well managed. Staff is so attentive and humble that one feels being treated so well. It is well kept lounge and comfortable both for business traveler and guests traveling on leisure trip.Hope the hotel is able to deliver consistent quality in future.","We spend a night at The JW Marriott Juhu.... it was amazing... thanks for the service, the kindness, the beautiful Suite. The breakfast was delicious, the location it’s perfect.Highly recommend.Look forward to come back."
