"Good service execellent breakfast and also good rooms.Only good for business stay.Good size rooms and bathroom and only disappointment is no shower gel or shampoo.Also not being provided with daily bottle of water ,have to ask for it otherwise no complaints.",Pros: Staff are good.Good connectivity with Metro and all other areas.Wifi was always workingFood are available at midnight to but don't expect it to be very tasty.Cons: Breakfast was not good on all the 5 days which we stayedRooms have AC which you cannot OFF at any point else your room will get filled with water.,"As a business traveler, Convenient place to stay if want to be in approach to in and around customers in Andheri,Vile Parle, Santacruz are and Airport.Old hotel but rooms are good but Bathrooms are smaller -Food is good with reasonably good service.Most of Taxi driver are not aware from Airport area. Landmark-Guru nanak petrol pump /near cinemax cinema/near western express highway","I came to Mumbai for some dental work and a bit of a look around as I'd never been to India before. I chose Residency because of its reviews in this forum. Overall it does hit the mark in most areas, but falls short on a couple.Let me start by saying, that if you are in Mumbai for business and you are looking for accomodation in this price band then Hotel Residency is a perfect fit.If like me you are here for a tiki tour then this may not be the place for you.Front desk check in ok. Efficient without being overjoyed to welcome you.I had a room on the 7th floor (701). Aircon and spacious. Good size room but if you leave the aircon off for a bit you can smell a mustiness that can become overpowering.Food is great. I'm from New Zealand and found the menu to be awesome. European breakfast and dinner options available.No probs getting taxis as there is a stand outside the hotel.I stayed for a week before moving on. In summary this hotel is for the business men and woman. All the comforts and details of a tourist hotel are not here, as apparent by its proximity to the tourist hotspots.I had a good stay, but had to catch at least 4 taxis every day to get around. Not a complaint, but a tip for others (outside India)who are looking for good accomodation closer to tourist areas.","Comfortable place to stay and ideally located, good staff always helpful. A decent business hotel which is well maintained and is easily connected with all parts of Mumbai - near to airport, adjacent to metro station and very near to Andheri local station. Food is owsem....",It was a nice experience staying at Residency Hotel.. recommend to my friends .. The best part is big size rooms & central AC.Very good food at comfortable rates.It is centrally located near to airport.,I stayed here on a business trip for three nights in May. The hotel is in easy reach of the airport and is well located for the metro and main roads too.The rooms are of a good size and clean and relatively well maintained.Breakfast was perfectly acceptable but there's not loads of variety if you're looking for something non-Indian. I love my Indian breakfasts so I was quite happy.Customer service was good and responsive. They changed my room quickly after a problem with the aircon in my room.,"Good can turn very good n other way round it could go an average. Residency hotel is an example of how good can become an average hotel.Good location, good rooms with basic amenities, but....We were provided only 2 towels, no small or hand towel , one of the towel was over used, warn out and with hanging threads, I called up house keeping, asked to change the towel n provide hand towel, which they did promptly, later on I show extra cover on the bed was torn n had hole of more than 2 inches n so was one of pillow cover with a hole of an inch, I photographed them to show it to reception.I believe this is a regular practice, of hoteliers specially for those guests who have booked through portal, Our room was booked through ""Yatra"", last March I had similar experience, at varanasi where I was given torn n stiched towel.Next morning, complimentary breakfast was okay.All concerned hotel staff members were cooperative.",Very Good. Awesome and highly recommended. Rooms are Awesome and the service is also very good. Booking through trip advisor is very much recommended as they provide some good deals and right tariff..............................................,"Stayed at this place on the night of 9th May 2017.Positives1. Pretty close to airport... just 20 minutes if traffic is light2. Tariff is reasonable3. Staff are very helpful and accommodating4. Bedsheets and linen are clean and crispNegatives1. Food is horrible2. There are no good restaurants nearby3. Hotel is old... rooms are done up but the age shows4. Breakfast is poor in spread and taste5. Hygiene seems to be poor.6. There are no separate tandoors for roti and non vegetarian dishes 7. Same tawa is used for vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes preparation8. Airport transfers are ridiculously expesive9. Water in tap in bathroom stinks and runs brown in colour at times10. Paid wifi is quite slowSpecial mention of Mr. Pramod at reception who took extra care to ensure my comfort during the stay. He is very well mannered, amiable and really listens to guests needs and tries to meet them."
