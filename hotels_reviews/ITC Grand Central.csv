Not only did he upgrade to a specious suite, but also saw to it that our 54th Wedding Anniversary was duly celebrated at the Hotel. Amid the Hotel staff, special mention needs to be made of Chelsea Thakur, Guest Relations Officer, who took great care of us through out our stay, and gave us her loving helping hand whenever we needed. She deserves all the Kudos from us. She and Sudha Mehra also joined us for dinner on our wedding anniversary day, and offered us a Happy Anniversary Card, a bouquet of roses, and a cake to cut on the occasion. The three chefs, Mahesh Jadhav, Rohan Narkar, and Umesh Sawant, at the Coffee Shop served us delicious, palatable, and non-spicy dishes of our choice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner during our two nights' stay at the Hotel. Their culinary skills need to be recognized by the Hotel",Beginning with a sow check in process their service really picked up over the days I was there.

It has several restaurants of high quality,"I had stayed recently from 26 - 29 Oct 2017. When I arrived on 26 Oct past 11pm, there were still quite a number of staff attending to guests who have arrived late in the night. Check-in was efficient, and staff attending to me was able to retrieve my booking efficiently, and was also quick to point out that I do not have breakfast and wifi for my booking. He had then cross-sold to me the hotel's wifi & breakfast bundled package.On my final night on 28 Oct, I had met with Guest Relations Executive Shahszia Khan. She recognized me from my previous stay. I requested her to see if she could grant me an extension of check-out time as my flight on 29 Oct is only at 11pm. Shahzia was quick to offer me an extended check-out time.I greatly appreciate the service. I had managed to have a good rest before heading to the airport to catch my red-eye flight.","Living in Malaysia which has no understanding of service what so ever, it was so refreshing coming to India from the customs staff to the taxi drivers, the service and pleasant nature of people was so refreshing.The Hotel is great, in the sort of grand old beautiful style, well looked after and overall a very enjoyable stay.
