"No doubt the international chain hotels are a class above the indian owned hotels...We were here just for a night but experienced peace in crowded Bombay city...the rooms nice and comfortable,and spacious unlike the ibis type there was no iron n board in place but was provided quickly.The bath supplies were biotic brand but provided only one set for two pax, specially when one needs to shower more than once a day in Bbay... but on request immediatly provided another set.Window views the Bbay suburbs and the new metro linking the west to east side...the hotel entry is just below the saki naka metro station...once the car gets in and you see the water fountains...you feel refreshed from the chaos n heat outside.The breakfast was grand from Indian to continental...even imported cheese...fresh watermelon juices, the stewards always very pleasant, Elstan took good care of us at breakfast.Was impressed with a notice about the timing rush for breakfast ...Throughly njoid our stay...more so the breakfast... unfortunately some guests are not dressed up ...rush from their beds lest they miss out on b/f.The front desk is not so efficient and may be understaffed, check-in and check-out out is very slow.","I originally booked one of the other international hotel chain's properties near BOM but changed to this one as soon as I realized that I could get 2-way airport transfer with almost the same rate. This made things a lot easier as I did not need to deal with the complications to getting to the hotel for a short transit stay. My flight arrived late but the hotel dispatcher and driver got me to the hotel in no time. It was after midnight but the front desk got me room service in lieu of the dinner buffet. It was just what I needed as it was late. As a IHG P-member, I got an upgraded corner room which was quite big. The decor was mix of modern and local tastes and looked well maintained. Breakfast was good, but I did not remember much as I had to prepare to checkout. The front desk was well trained and showed me currency options before finalizing the paperwork. He then got me the shuttle car to T2 in just minutes. It was pouring when I checked out but I did not get a drop of rain on me before I entered T2. Overall it was a great experience.","We travelled from Australia and had a wonderful time! Hotel is excellent, restaurant is out of this world (spoilt for choice delectible spreads on offer that tastes out of this world) , super friendly n helpful staff and they have Niroj who is the best housekeeping staff in the world! Kudos","I stayed for 3 nights and it was one of the best hotels I've ever visited.The wifi was not working properly but I was not charged more than up to the time I reported that.The breakfast was amazing, and even if i checked in at 10.30 am because of my early flight,my room was ready after 20 mints.Thank you for everything.",Very nice and well located hotel with the saki naka metro station just a stone throw away. The staff is friendly and helpful. Break fast platter is great and variety also is great. It's proximity to the airport also helps as you don't get stuck in famous Mumbai traffic,"Overall a wonderful stay. Will definitely visit again if I travel to Mumbai !Positives :1) Check in was a breeze2) Friendly and responsive reception staff. Very welcoming.3) Very efficient one touch service4) Good restaurants and service5) Gym and Tattva spa is excellent 6) New metro station is bang opposite the hotel (2 minutes walk)7) Free wifi and newspaper (for IHG members)Negatives :1) Location outside the hotel /view is not exciting and quite dirty (Not in hotel's control) 2) Check out queue could have been better handled.3) Steep pick up/drop charges to domestic airport. Suggest to use other alternatives like uber/ola. 4) Swimming pool is pretty small for adults, but good for toddlers/kids. (3ft depth, temperature controlled)","""Great ambience, tasty food, amazing room service good rooms and yummy food, especially Thai food.Except biryani, other north Indian dishes are excellent its at a great location too. Nice place to stay if you need a place near Mumbai airport.","Visited mumbai on 28th-29th October 2017, booked this Hotel through booking.com, two mistakes at once. First, the site booking.com is never clear of the true prices, I ended up paying 24% GST beyond the assured LOWEST prices offered ṭo me. I've been bitten twice by booking.com, first while booking my honeymoon and this was the second instance. I would suggest everyone should be aware of it!!Next the hospitality of HOTEL HOLIDAY INN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is only to SHOW that they care while they don't care at all. After we checked in, the bell boy clearly ignored to acknowledge that we had some luggage and May need help with the same, never asked if we needed any help with it. I don't want to name him here but we came across him thrice and his behaviour was same all the times.Thirdly, the hotel maybe near airport but the location was so crowded that through the window you could directly see the poorly maintained apartments with practically NOTHING else to see. I've attached a photograph. The only positive point was the location and that the rooms were clean.  I think anyone should be thinking atleast twice before booking it because there are hotels with better locations anD better value for money. ","Fantastic welcome at this hotel! We only stayed one night but it was great. Beautiful room with many extras provided for our wedding anniversary - thank you so much. We ate at the buffet restaurant for dinner and everything we had was superb! All staff were friendly and helpful. We had an early morning flight so could not experience breakfast. It was really easy to get to and from the international airport from this hotel. Rooftop pool looked very inviting but we did not have time to use it unfortunately. Well done, Holiday Inn! ","The vast lobby was very tastefully done, with walls plastered with botanical art, high chandeliers and the warm-toned lighting that adds an extra touch of luxury. We were given a room on the seventh floor, not with great views because this was an airport hotel after all, but with a comfy bed, soft carpeting, TV, writing desk and tea/coffee maker – all in an earthy colour scheme. Our bathroom was not too bad either. The only thing missing was a balcony. After a refreshing cup of coffee, we set about exploring the hotel.Tattva spa was on the very same floor, while the fitness centre and swimming pool were on the top floor, along with a beautiful rooftop garden. The best part about the fitness centre was the view of Mumbai city with the mountains beyond. Of course, the array of fitness equipment was also impressive. In the evening, we enjoyed treatments at Tattva spa (shirodhara and potli massage). After our treatment, we made it to the rooftop right in time for sunset.We really like the space-saving concept of wall gardens, which has become popular in hotels worldwide. We wandered around admiring the flowers and views in the soothing saffron warmth of the descending sun. Late evening was the best time to take a dip in the glorious infinity pool with sweeping views of the city and mountains and miniature palms on either side.We enjoyed a scrumptious dinner and breakfast at Saptami, the all-day dining restaurant at the lobby. 72, the bar adjacent to the restaurant seemed to have many exciting offers as well."
