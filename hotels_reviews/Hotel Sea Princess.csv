"-DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL, -HAD A LOT OF MONEY STOLLEN FROM SAFE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO DAMAGE - can clearly see someone has opened the safe-CCTV shows a member of management entering during the hours of the room being empty and leaving 3 minutes later - HOTEL DOES NOTHING & takes no responsibility.Disgusting!!! Avoid!!!!!!!!!",We went out for 30 minutes and someone stole £2000 from our safe.. when looking back at the CCTV we saw the manager walk into our room and walk out 5 minutes later. when we spoke to the reception they accused us of lying and would not co-operate. We had to force them to show the CCTV and you can clearly see the manager walking in and out 5 minutes later and no one else walking in or out of the room.,Stayed here for 3 night's in Oct in the beach facing luxury room and this is our honest feedback for the same..Staff-lots of old faces and old guns in the armour. This hotel is a old hotel and probably believes that old is gold. Staff are friendly and helpful esp at the restaurant and the live food counters. Seen a lot of happy and smiling faces throughout our stay right from the bell desk to the housekeeper boys. 3.5/5.Rooms- neat and clean. The room was well maintained but the mattress and pillows need to be upgraded to better ones. Could have been better. The laundry service was quick and the room boys did a good job. Full marks to housekeeper boys and room cleaning. The location is a crowd puller and the view from the room is breathtaking. 4/5.Food- Delicious would be an understatement. The food looks much better than it actually tastes to tell you the truth. You really don't feel like eating it the way it's garnished.Superb! The chefs make your day in the mornings at the egg counter and dosas. Very friendly and outgoing unlike other hotels in the vicinity. Full marks to food presentation and taste. Breakfast spread the best so far we have tried in all 5 stars. Foodies paradise I must admit. 4.5/5.Cons-1) lot of noise of some civil work happening in the day time is a big put off and deprives you of good day naps. 2) Wi-Fi should be made cheap if not free. We are in the 21 century guys. 3) there should be more Jain and gluten free options in the dinner buffet. 4) no shower caps in the pool pls and no forcing business pls.not acceptable for a 5 star hotel.That's it for now till we visit you next. Keep up the efforts and looking forward to stay here again in Dec.Till then adeus.,"I m staying in room no 421 and my room next room is suit room, never ever expect from your hotel that much noise comes in my room. With me my 1yr old baby girl and she disturb whole night & when we decide to give her good sleep In noon so there room clean noise start. Suit room bathroom connect with 421room so bathroom water noise whole night, at last around 3am I need to complain on reception & same this thing start in noon... not happy this time with your service , even I ask for extra water bottle for my baby so your staff said it’s a chargeable not complimentary, so it mean in whole day & night u need to stay in 4bottle only. Visit 421 & heard how noise comes from suit room , after u get to know suggest this room to anyone or not ... ","The stay was pleasant for the 3 nights i spent there. Check in was smooth...since there was a lack of King size bed in my category they upgraded me (with a little bit of haggling though)..The room was spacious and had all the basic amenities. Stay was comfortable. Had an access to the beach,,which was good...Pool looked good however did not use it..Breakfast was good, however felt the Dosas could have been better. Room service menu can offer a little more of variety considering what the Hotel had to offer in the other restaurant. Check out was smooth.","WARNING- if you are paying a security amount to this hotel be careful!!! We stayed from 26-28th September and paid 4000 INR as security. They have not returned it till now inspite of continuous follow up. They don't call back either. The hotel claims to be a 5 star only basis of being a sea side property. Rest nothing is 5 star about it. Rooms have old furniture, soggy smell & old bath fittings.Breakfast layout is decent but good quality that of a 3 star hotel. The staff asked me to pay extra for the fruit 'kiwi' when I was picking fruits from fruit basket laid out at the buffet. Wifi is chargeable only for online bookings in today's date where most bookings are online. If you directly book with the hotel it isn't! Ground staff, waiting staff is nice but managerial and above is pathetic. Not at all helpful and cooperative. To everything they had one answer- it's a policy.We travel a lot for business and leisure. This is one of the worst and the value one gets for the price is really low. Not returning there for sure. There are much better hotels. ","I have stayed here a few times. The services and facilities were average, not bad. The location is good, which has been the prime the reason of my choice. However recently I had booked this property through a portal with a ""No Cancellation Fee"" which was to end 48 hours before arrival. Due to very inclement weather in Mumbai my meetings got cancelled and I informed the property that I will not be checking in, which I did about 36 hours before scheduled arrival. I did not want a refund. I proposed a new date where the booking could be shifted agreeing to pay any extra costs. The answer was clear 'no"". So I was charged 2 full days (about Rs 18000) without stepping in to the property. Legally they had a right to do what they did. I thought I should put this up for those who want to go beyond just the amenities that a hotel offers",The sea princess most fraud hotel seen in my life as they referred me to take a membership and once i got convinced as paid for my membership and there were some amenities to be given as per the mail they sent me and later they totally changed their statement..I cancelled my membership and asked for the refund so they were suppose to refund back month but they failed on their commitments and now stopped reverting back and answering calls..never seen a pathetic and unprofessional fraud hotel like this..,"Oceanic DelightsIt is one thing to look like a celebrity and just another when someone makes you feel like one! I experienced this exacting feeling at the Sea Princess Hotel, in Mumbai. I cannot thank Jerson Monterey Jack and his team enough to enliven my spirits and transport me straight to cloud nine! I started off with a ‘mixed berry juice’, dominated by fresh strawberries. This totally revved my spirits and I couldn’t wait to down the sumptuous spread on the buffet. The buffet imparted a global air with dishes from around the world dotting the rather enticing spread. The presentation of the salads and dessert was simply awe-inspiring. I was amazed at the creativity that was invested in each of the dishes. The flavours were authentic, and the food was fresh; and cooked to finger-licking perfection. I started off the chef’s very special, ‘Organic Garden Green salad’, complete with orange scented quinoa quenelles, caramelized walnuts, and herb crusted crisps. I also savoured the activated charcoal scented ‘Pav Bhaji Di Gaddi’ (A very rural but most cherished mixed vegetable preparation cooked in a special assortment of spices, served with bread, finely chopped onions, pomegranate seeds, and a crispy savoury snack called ‘Sev’. I couldn’t but marvel at the ‘Chemistry Lab’, a shredded chicken dish topped off with cream, and roasted on a skewer on an open fire kiln (tandoor). The biryani too was differently presented. The neatly piled rice was topped off with a patty (meat / vegetarian) and flat bread, and was completed with a ‘Papad’ (A crispy roasted lentil savoury, which is often preferred fried as well). The array of other dishes included the wood tossed pizzas, which a thin and crispy base, a melange of vegetables that included the famed corn and spinach mix completed in Indian spices, the ‘Sahi vegetable mix’ (completed in a creamy gravy), and a lot more. The list continues onward to a black lentil prep, a ‘Pulav’ (a vegetable and meat infused rice preparation complete with the fragrant aroma of saffron), Haka Noodles (A Chinese favourite), Ravioli (Tossed in red sauce and olives), Mixed vegetable done in hot bean sauce and shezwan, stir fried vegetables and a lot more. I also cherished the desserts that were skilfully arted to perfection. I cannot stop ranting about the delicious ‘Walnut Halva’ (finely grinded walnuts, tossed in clarified butter, and cooked with sugar, cardamom, and saffron), the caramel custard, enticing array of cheesecakes, fruit panacottas, some fusion desserts, and many more. What starred the show was the ‘Chocolate Bomb’ (another of the chef’s special) complete with a creamy cheesecake, and a whiskey caramel hot sauce, parked inside a chocolate dome. The dish delectably opens up as molten chocolate is poured onto the chocolate dome, revealing the internal goodies. The restaurant overlooks the Mumbai horizon and the beachy reserves that border the city. I caught a whiff of the upcoming winter into my hair. The Sea Princess Hotel serves as a the perfect brunch destination, frequented by the city’s celebrity circuit. Truly Chef Jerson Monterey Jack can make one feel like a star at any hour!","SeaPrincess is an awesome choice suggested by my friend and I had lovely 2-3 business days spent at this hotel. Their rooms were clean ,staff was courteous and very hospitable environment. I would love to choose this hotel again if coming to mumbai ..Also it is a sea facing restaurant with ever lovely sea breeze on 24x7..lovely time spent ..!"
