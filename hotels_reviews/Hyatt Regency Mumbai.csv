"I stayed at the Hyatt Regency last night. The hotel is located next to Terminal 2 near Mumbai Airport. The location is great. What makes it even better is that they offered us a complimentary airport pick up and drop. The check in and check out is smooth. The rooms are functional. The TV placed in the room is small but that's okay as I only needed to catch up on the news briefly in the morning. One area where Hyatt can improve significantly is hospitality. This morning, we had an early check out and hit the coffee shop for a light breakfast (fruits / muesli). Time was 6am. The breakfast officially opens at 6:30am. The staff were not the most friendly. In any other 5 star property, one can have fruits and Muesli which are already at the counter. Thankfully, the staff at the reception were surprised by this behaviour by the restaurant staff. Obviously, there is a disconnect / communication gap. I hope the hotel management fixes this. You would otherwise not want to use a hotel property which offers poor hospitality. There are just so many better options available - the Taj Santacruz is so much better with better rooms and amazing hospitality. It's located near Terminal 1. ","A nice & excellent hotel to visit , very close to International Airport and surrounded by so many other brands of hotel.The choice always remains only Hyatt Regency Mumbai . The restaurants are well maintained, Staff are very courteous. Buffet breakfast is amazing and elaborate . Colorful cutting Chai glasses ,So many juices and choices of breakfast one can spend whole day just relaxing from restaurant to spa to pool to club lounge and very attractive lobby which has a instaphoto booth , lots of local information. Rooms are excellent. A must hotel to stay and enjoy the services","It’s my home away from home and something I look forward to each time I visit Mumbai. A big thanks to Sandesh for taking such great care starting with the greeting at the arrival to escorting straight to my room and from time to time a surprise upgrade to an exec room. Keep up the great job you do and I’ll see you yet again, hopefully sooner than later!!!",Its located close by Mumbai airport so good for people has flight late night and early morning. Their rooms were designed modern enough. They have also good restaurant in their lobby floor. We enjoyed their crispy pizza and nice imported wines.,The reason for writing this review is to congratulate staff at Glasshouse.Staff at Glasshouse was very efficient. In spite of restaurant being full in morning staff was courteous and worked efficiently. The room was comfortable and quiet.,"First impression was pleasant at reception. When i arrived at my room it smelled like urine, the carpet under the bed was filthy. Being in the second floor, i had access to a business lounge, i could have my breakfast and a snack at dinner time with drinks included. Although the place was comfortable the ambient music was too loud, i had to ask to turn it down a bit. People were bringing the kids so it became noisy again. I few guests showed up in full gym gear still sweating. Not a very special hotel, just average. It needs better cleaning, odour control, noise control.Food was ok.","The location is perfect, very close to the airport. Just what one needs for a business trip.I loved the layout of the bathroom the most, highly luxurious. Room was huge, classy and comfortable. Bedding was ok, presentation of the bed was pretty average at first look. Also had a tough time figuring out the master switch for the room lights, eventually gave up. Maybe they can work on that. Did not have time to explore breakfast food options or the property but sure to come back to try !Overall, purely from a business point of view, it's good to go.",I spent an amazing time here with friends in the wee morning hours. I also had an coffee in the coffee shop which was really good and smooth. The lobby is very beautiful and have ample of space to spend time.,amazing service and the staff was very helpful and well mannered. The food is great and the breakfast buffet is excellent.The restaurant has good variety of veg & non veg food.my stay with my family was very good and memorable.,"The Presidential suite at Hyatt Regency Mumbai, with its ultimate luxury, provides an enriching experience. I had booked the suite for a night last week, and I had a fantastic time with my family. The living room is built like a giant dome with many comfortable sofas to relax & just chill. A large tv at one corner is connected to a system with Bose speakers all over the ceiling of the dome, giving amazing auditorium like sound effects. You can connect your mobile/tablet to the system to listen to the music of your choice. A brightly-lit bar adorns one corner of the living room with all the necessary equipment, while a study table is placed at the other corner. A giant dining table with seating for 8 people is at the far end of the room. Next to the dining room is a fully-equipped kitchen. The bedroom has a king-size bed, a sofa, a tv and a recliner with 5 different massage options. The attached bathroom is big & equipped with a Jacuzzi. There are different passages which connect the living room, kitchen and bedroom. Brilliant paintings adorn the walls in all the rooms and the furniture is state-of-the-art. The only problem we faced was that the air-conditioning in the bedroom was not working properly and could not be fixed despite 2 attempts by the housekeeping staff, so we had to keep the bedroom doors open to allow the A/Cs from the living room to cool the bedroom. It was the only hitch to an otherwise perfect experience. The dinner as well as breakfast at the hotel had a big spread with cuisines from across the world. A memorable stay in the lap of luxury."
