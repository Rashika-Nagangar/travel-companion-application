Staff was excellent and very helpful. I have never seen such staff entire life.Restaurant staff was also good. Very helpful & coportive all round staff. Location of hotel is good. Ideal for couples stay.,"The hotel is best & staff is very cooperative. But the food is not very good , few options for vegetarian people. The overall food is pretty expensive could not find many food options. The breakfast menu is repeated for both the days. Dosa is severed on request basis.",I had my 4 days in wonderful way however Samriddh and rest of the other stuff was amazing...I am really thrilled to see the entire hospitality of Trident. Good luck to entire team.I will be coming again for sure soon.,"This business hotel is very well located in BKC. Staff very well behaved and friendly. Always sporting a great smile. Had a very good stay with their personal touch and care in making my room comfortable and looking into the things I needed.Special Mention:Housekeeping staffs - Ashwin & Pooja, who remembered that I liked lemon grass fragrance during my last visit and ensured that I had the same this time as wellHousekeeping Staff - Ketan, who noticed that my personal shaving foam was about to finish and got me a new one as a gift. Thanks!Housekeeping Staff Priyanka - who observed that I work a lot on my laptop and gifted me with a laptop cleaner. Thanks!IRD : Ritesh who rushed at late hours to get me a hot herbal drink without me asking, to heal my bad cough which I had during my last trip. It helped me get some sleep!IRD : Asish, a name I always remember in my trips to this hotel. He has been taking extra care in looking into all my needs, be it missing green tea and coffee sachet in my room, to empty candle carton to light the lemon grass diffuser, to getting me a herbal tea to heal my cough, to enquiring about my health which was not great this time when I was staying in this hotel. Over and above that when I was checking out he on knowing I like banana cakes, gave me a small hamper of banana cakes, along with some wonderful and the best cookies I had ever and some diyas. A very big Thank you to you Asish. Would remember you gesture always!At the end I would like to mention all these wonderful people are part of this great brand called Trident and without their training and grooming, I don't think they could have been this good. I wish them all the best and surely they are going to do very well in the hospitality Industry!","I arrived at 1am on a delayed flight and the airlines had misplaced my bags. The Trident driver stayed until I came out and had cold water and a cold napkin for me to freshen up. Once I got to the hotel, they arranged for toiletries (hair gel, shaving kit, etc) and told me that I could get a shirt from the hotel store that opened at 8am. I got my shirt the next morning and the entire experience was excellent. The breakfast is exceptional!","every thing is excellent. at lest on day allow to breakfast to family,

Food was great too.
Kids friendly.
Provided transportation to nearby places. Staff brought toys for the kids. Great stay","Services has deteriorated due to lack on consistency. Every time the rules gets change for example asked for some particular room but was told that's a premium room, asked for water and while billing water become chargeable. Ask for tea while breakfast not served, asked to rectify the cable TV being told it will take some time and left as it is,",I checked in early due to my visa issues and checked out late. The staff was friendly and responded in a quick and efficient manner. The only problem was the kettle which was unclean and hence we couldn't use it. Rest this is a very good place to stay with delicious food options as well.,"Iâ€™ve been staying at this property for over 4 years now and it has only gotten better. My visit this time has been extremely pleasant, Vikrant Sharma from the Guest services to folks in the FO, Super!"
