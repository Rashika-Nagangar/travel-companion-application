"I am here for 5 nights. This is a basic hotel (no frills) but I like it because everything works. Internet is free and good connection. Air conditioning works perfectly (I like it cold). Room is clean with a refrigerator. TV has many channels (USA & Indian). The breakfast buffet is truly wonderful (about US$35 for 5 days). I eat a huge breakfast and this lasts me until dinner. I can work very efficiently in my room. For dinner, I had fish curry and garlic nan (around US$10) and it was the nicest fish curry of my life. My waiter, Ganesh, kept getting me bits to eat from the dinner buffet while I waited for my fish curry - all without charge. I think the dinner buffet (also huge) is around US$20; I think it is probably worth it. I arrived at 4 a.m. at the International Terminal, the car sent by hotel costs me US$17 - which I thought was a little high for such a short trip. I now realize that Uber workers here. I opened Uber on my phone and everything looked perfect. So, next time, I would use Uber for transportation. I think (???) the hotel car is free if going to the domestic terminal (not sure about this). I like this hotel. I am happy here. I would definitely come back.","IBIS is an excellent hotel for a quick business visit. It took less than 10 mins to and from the International Airport.Unfortunately and surprisingly there is no free airport pick-up/ shuttle except from the domestic airport. The added service is about INR 1,100 (US$ 17). The Prepaid Taxi counter from the airport quoted INR 300 for air-conditioned taxi. Unfortunately, their credit card machine didn't 'connect' and I ended up going to another pre-paid taxi counter which charged INR 800 for a distance of less than 4Km!However, my disappointment was short-lived as from the hotel security at the front door onward, I could tell the service was going to be above par. The front desk was so welcoming and made sure I was properly briefed re. my facilities. So much so, the front office staff walked with me to the coffee shop and poured me a cappuccino as I had arrived on a 02:10am flight. Brilliant!The smoking room I requested was in super condition; the room was well lit, fragrant and cool with the toilet in pristine condition. The shower cubicle was spacious and immaculate to say the least.The restaurant had a decent selection for breakfast. Lunch and dinner options were good but limited to a fussy traveler like me... but hey, this is a business hotel and I was flying out in less than 24 Hrs. Didn't even have time to enjoy the comfy bed and pillows for too long in worry of missing my 11:00 am meeting and flight at 3:00am; though I managed to squeeze in 6 showers in the high pressure shower... Bliss!",We stayed there after a mid night arrival at Mumbai airport. Staff is very cooperative & hotel is in great conditions with all the amenities for a short stay. Room view is not that great but you won't need to open if it is a short stay :P,"This was the second time was staying at IBIS Mumbai airport and stay was for 5 nights on a business trip. The hotel did not disappoint - flawless & efficient rooms which you can expect in an IBIS brand. I had my business meetings in Goregaon - East and the location of this hotel is amazing, since you are going against the traffic in morning and evening, so you save on travel time. Room sizes are typical IBIS style - added to that, this is heart of Mumbai, so do not expect anything more than the basic space to move to your bed, desk and bathroom. But for a business traveller like me who left the hotel at 8 am and returned at 8pm, that was fine. The highlight of this stay was the excellent restaurant service. I reached out to Chef Rizwan at the restaurant, requesting for some home cooked, low spice food and he obliged for every single meal. Now for a frequent business traveller - that is a big big plus point to get meals which are tasty and to your palate. Thank you Chef Rizwan ! Overall a very business friendly and hassle free stay.","A no nonsense business hotel. A comfortable yet luxurious stay. The food tastes good and the spread of the buffet is pretty decent according to the price. As itâ€™s a business hotel, there are not much services available. So pretty much stay the night and eat is the thing to do, if ur purpose to stay there is not business.","Room sizes are very small. I feel Room and food are priced on the higher side for the size of the room and the food they serve. This is only a 3-star property, not 5-star property. We have to give money deposit or pay at the time of service itself at the restaurant or in-house dining or other services. Their breakfast starts at 4am but you will receive only muffins and corn flakes. Nobody cares to serve water. They provide free wifi and airport drop.","The hotel's distance from the airport makes it convenient for short stayovers and business trips, The rooms and washroom were neat though a little smaller than expected. The staff was exceptionally courteous and co-operative.",I stayed at ibis Mumbai airport hotel recently and had a wonderful stay. The location is just perfect and reached the hotel in 2 minutes from the airport.Rooms are clean and wifi is complimentary. Breakfast had lots of varieties and they were serving hot Dosas and parathas made fresh in front of you. Overall an amazing stay,Stayed here for 2 nights must say that the hotel staff is very friendly accommodative and always ready to help. Breakfast was good and rooms were very comfortable.Airport is very nearby and closest mall is Oberois mall which is also superb,Good location near the hotels. Rooms and bathroom too small for the price and competition available nearby. Breakfast and service very good. staff very hospitable. no complaints. should provide transport facility for International guest
