"Stayed here for a week with the family in late October. Noticeable how many staff there are in comparison to European hotels and provides for excellent service which was both friendly and efficient. The bedrooms are well appointed with very good views. Endless supply of bottled water in the rooms which was very handy. The seven kitchens restaurant delivered incredible variety at breakfast therefore you could have anything from a delicious masala dosa to bacon and eggs or continental style cuisine. The hotel sits directly above a high end shopping centre, which also has a good choice of restaurants and a food hall, therefore you can stock up on various items if you so wish. The gym had lots of equipment and the outside pool on the 10th floor was great for catching the morning and lunchtime sunshine. Great hotel and would definitely go again ",Mr Manohar throughout my short stay was excellent personality he made the room available when it was not with special arrangements I would like to come back always because of Mr Chawla thank you for your kind hospitality you have made my stay memorable,"This is a fabulous hotel. One if the nicest I have stayed in. Nice decor, rooms were spacious and comfy, with large bathroom. Restaurant open 24hrs which was handy as I checked in very late and was feeling hungry and didn't fancy ordering room service. There was a butler on my floor but I did not have time to fully utilise the service. A shame I only spent a night. Hoping to have a longer stay next time.","Get ready to be pampered with excellent service, elegance, and superb dining. I stayed for 2 nights, in a suite, and found the room to be a den of zen. Clean, sleek, peaceful, with excellent wifi and amenities. The butler service was unparalleled. The buffet breakfast at Seven Kitchens was unlike any other - with freshly-made dishes, a variety of breads, cheeses, condiments, and foods of different ethnicities. The same goes for dinner. I also tasted the best thai green curry ever, at the MeKong restaurant. The grand drawing room on the 9th floor will take you to another time and space. A lovely moment to treasure. Finally, the staff was superb, in terms of politeness, service and attention to detail. All with a genuine smile.",Had drinks and dinner at the St. Regis and spent an unforgettable evening with Stefan playing all our favorites - new and old - on the piano. Hope we’ll see him again soon - at the Regis or on a cinema screen somewhere! Thanks for wonderful food and great entertainment!,St. Regis has all the typical amenities one would expect from a great 5 star hotel in India. Buffet has the widest selection of international and Indian cuisine and bar choices are ample too. They also offer a great room service with a decent choice of international and local food items. Butler service for rooms is a very unique concept. Rooms are very spacious and that itself is a big luxury to have that too in South Mumbai. Check in process in very smooth and the staff across every function at St. Regis is very courteous.,Fantastic as usual. Same consistent breakfast with so many option to select. Don’t know why they’ve stop serving alcohol at Asilo the roof top bar. Good cleanliness in rooms and friendly staff specially the Butler service is bonus. ,Amazing hotel and service!!!Once in a lifetime experience!!!Special thanks to the head butler shakir and our personal butler preetum! Because of you our stay was incredible! Moria shahar & Lihi frider ,"I Checked Into This Hotel With My Wife & 2Kids On 14Th Oct 2017 For 2Nights But From The Time We Got Down From The Car At The Porch Till The Time We Were Getting Back Into The Car After The Checkout, I Must Say The Experience Has Been Awesome/Overwhelming/Outstanding(Cant Remember Anymore Expressions) Usually I Dont Write Much Reviews Since I Dont Get Much Impressed By The Hotels So Easily.But With The Kind Of Service We Received From This Hotel Right From The Valet, The Reception(During Checkinn), Especially The Butlet Mr.Chirag Gosavi(5Plus Stars For The Him) He Explained Us Each & Everything About The Hotel's Ammenities, Their Outlets, Their Butler Service, 2Thumps Up For His Patience To Explain Us All This In Detail.When We Went For Dinner In Their Oneof The Restaurant ""Seven Kitchen"" Where We Met Mr.Hemant(Even 5Stars For Him Too) Who Is One Of The Manager Of That Outlet. Even He Took Great Care Of Us. Since My Kids Were Also Accompanying Us Mr,Hemant Made Sure That The Kids Are Served With Their Favourite Dishes & Their Favourite Soft Drinks.During The Meal He Used To Come To Us & Used To Suggest Thier Most Popular Dishes Which We Had Not Tried From The Buffet Till Then.I Also Observed That All The Staff In The Whole Hotel Was So Attentive That If Of The Guest Is Sitting Alone/Idle Then They Used To Go To That Guest & Used To Chat With That Guest Just To Make Sure The Guest Is Not Getting Bored/Or Felling Lonely (Which I Liked The Most)I Liked Thier Super-Friendly Approach Which Was Not Too Much & Not Even Less.I Have Been To Most Of The Branded 3Star-5Star Hotels But In Most Of The Hotels I Have Observed The Staff There Just Used To Do Thier Duty & Thats It, Whileas Here It Was Not The Same, They Used To Make Sure That Everything Is Taken Care & If Required They Whould Go Out Of The Way To Make A Guest Feel More Than Just Satsified.They Also Have So Many Different Kinds Of Outlets Right From Cafes, To Restaurants, To Spa To Salon To Swimming Pools Etc Plus It Is Just Next To The Very Well Know & The Best Mall Of Mumbai.Haah!!!!! Cant Get Tired Of Praising Them.I Serioulsy Dont Know How Do I Thank The Whole Team Of St.Regis But Can Just Sayhatsoff To Team St Regis. I Also Feel There Should Have Been More Hotels Like This Pan India & Abroad.Feels Great To Share This Review.....Thank You",Amazing place to have business meet ... excellent service ... it is certainly one of the best if not the best coffee shop cum bar in Mumbai ... i am regular at the drawing room whenever I have time I go there to chill
