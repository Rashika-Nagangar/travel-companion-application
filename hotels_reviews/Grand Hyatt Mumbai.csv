"We had a whistlestop 3 day stay at the Grand Hyatt. Staff were extrememly friendly and professional, the rooms were clean and the food options were perfect. The only downside, and we can live with it, is our room was difficult to navigate to - up to one level then down to another. but it kept us fit.... Definitely recommend and if I could add half rating extra I would. also recommend the Dhiravi slum tour through Reality Tours while you are here.","We usually stay at the JWM on Juhu, however a family member was staying at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and convenienced us to cancel and book here, So we did. The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is truly an amasing hotel. From entrance you fell you are in a 5 star luxury hotel. Our initial room was very small for two adults and 2 children (4 and 1), however the staff promptly resolved this and gave a much larger better room.Rooms are generious size and kept to a very high standard. I could not find any fault within the rooms so though to take a wonder around the hotel whilst the wife and kids have a nap. Around the hotel there are many meeting points and rooms, obviously this is popular for businesses. The breakfast menu if 1st class, from English breakfast to Indian breakfast and eggless croissants.You cannot go wrong with the Grant Hyatt Mumbai! Nice pool and awesome staff!",I found the carpets shabby and the rooms not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. Took about 2 hours to return passport after check in. Concierge & counter staff are friendly and helpful. Restaurant staff are also courteous & nice.,"I stayed in Grand Hyatt Mumbai along with my family during the Christmas and New year of 2017. One word is ""Grand"". We thoroughly enjoyed the huge variety of breakfast buffet. There are two beautiful swimming pools and a huge gym. The interior of the hotel is mesmerizing. ","Adnan, the young gentleman who welcomed us at Grand Hyatt was too good. Very pleasant and he goes out of his way to give you that little plus which makes all the difference. Great guy and hope he has a long and successful carreer at Hyatt. He is all smile and sweet. If I come back to Hyatt next year, it will cerytainly be mainly because of his care and assistance in ecerything we wanted.Sheela from Mauritius.We are leaving a wonderful friend behind...","I stayed in this hotel during a business travel. I think that was the best decision of the trip. I had a super comfy stay, thanks to the very caring and prompt staff, great rooms and service. I also enjoyed dinner at Cellini, their Italian restaurant. I recommend the Tiramisu, it was perfect! Would love to come back for a family trip and stay longer.","Everything was amazing!The room was big and clean, the staff was nice and helpful, the food in the restaurants was delicious, specially the chicken biryani at Soma. The pool is very nice.Only thing that was missing was the channels in the tv, there wasn't enough channels, and few of them didn't worked.But it's not so bad..",The Grand Hyatt is a welcoming retreat in the hear of the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. The staff are warm and welcoming and go out of their way to assist in anyway they can. I had a problem with the aircon in my room and they did not stop until they had fixed the problem. The range of restaurants and bars is great and provides for any tastes. The rooms are very well appointed with modern amenities. The gym is excellent. The standard WifI is woeful however so pay the extra and upgrade to the premium offering.,Absolutely a fantastic stay. It is close to the airport. Check-in was easy and smooth. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. They have a bathtub in the rooms which helps you relax after a busy day at work. A complimentary bowl of fruits was given each day which was so thoughtful. Food was good. You won't be able to access any other floor other than the one which has your room. Guess its some regulation in India!! Overall a happy experience with hardly any negatives.,Hotel was amazing! Staff especially Alex at front office and Najma at the spa were exceptional. Food at the indian restaurant was superb. I would love to go back again! Every little request was dealt with. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you for making my family’s stay so memorable. I can’t wait to revisit
