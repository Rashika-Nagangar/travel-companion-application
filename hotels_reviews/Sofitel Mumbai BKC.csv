"What a beautiful hotel! I only wish I'd had more time to explore all the bars and restaurants. The food was fantastic, the staff super attentive, and the rooms sumptuous and lovely. I even took advantage of a massage at the spa very late in the evening before my 2am flight - what a great way to pass the time before departure.","I stayed at Sofitel on both business and leisure with my family. My expectations were not so high as I think going in unrealistic expectations always leads to disappointment. I stayed in a Junior suit and had the full airport service thrown in. The taxi was on time when I landed at Mumbai. The driver was presented well and spoke fluent English that help create a conversation with him. The car was very clean with refreshments. Our check in was seamless. We were escorted to our room and was shown all the facilities and the porter checked we were happy otherwise move us to something else, which I thought was very personal To end on a positive the staff at this hotel were the reason we would recommend this hotel, from the breakfast teams to business lounge workers who worked tirelessly to ensure we enjoyed every minute in the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure trips. I look forward to coming back next year. ",Hi - i visited Jyran with family - it was my wife's birthday - it was memorable experience as the food was awesome and ambience was very pleasing - over and above courteous stewards and managers with prompt service made it a memorable experience - special thanks to Kevin Payal and Saket at Jyran for wonderful memories,"We had booked a Club room for 2 Nights and were upgraded to a Prestige room with all the Clubsmille Facilities.

Good location with well connected to all suburbs. Well groomed and trained staff to handle queries. I personally recommend to be here while in Mumbai.,Sofitel is a very good luxury hotel in Mumbai. Though the room is small but the interiors and presence of big bath tub makes it look premium. The choice of restaurants is good especially the one serving south India cuisine. ,"Excellent HospitalityThis is my first stay at a Sofitel.
