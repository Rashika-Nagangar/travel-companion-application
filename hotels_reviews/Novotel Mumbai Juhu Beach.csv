"The room was dirty, the floor smells. the price for meal or drinks was extremle expensive. (beer about 7 Euro). no reaction of the managment on the blames. I' was with a groupe with some people and all of them complained!",Amazing place great Hospitality offer by the hotel.great place to be and equally good value for money.do ho for their buffets and brunch you will love it.i t is located in one of plush localities of mumbai .it is a bit expensive though.,"It is rare to see a so much horrible hotel at this price. I would rather say I have never seen so much dirty hotel.The rooms are not cleaned, I do not even speak about the smelling...The view on the sea is quite fair but the beach dirty.Please avoid this hotel...","Situated on the Juhu beach, its an Average property.The location is the obvious good part about the Hotel.If your room is Sea facing, its a great view of course.However, the maintainence of the property can certainly be better. I understand that the outer facade is difficult owing the Sea and its effects.Its the interiors which need a facelift.Its very average, even for higher category rooms which provide Executive lounge access.Nothing is bad, but everything is just Okayish.There is no wow factor.Even the service needs to get better.Hallmarks of this Industry is Customer delight and Hospitality towards them.The Upholstery, washrooms, Bed- all can be a two notches better for the Prices charged.Even the food at The Square and the Italian one, i didnt try Baggecha- were Average",I stayed 2 Night and 3 days in the property.While making the booking request I had request for a best clear sea view room.My overall experience of this property and its service is disappointing.It is a very busy hotel the staff at all customer service area are robotic and lack understanding of customer centric service.The rooms and most of the fixture in and around hotel looks tired and needs some maintainance.My room view was a complete let down.The location of the property has the advantage of sea view but due overall poor maintainance of the ambiance and tired looking service.I will not recommend.,"we stayed on our transit to south although we were in executive room the room size is pretty small,hotel is very busy the breakfast area is crowded and restaurent is not spic and span too gloomy and needs a renovation its a bit run down ,the pool service is bad take 45 minutes for an order.but for the price you pay and if you are going to be out the whole day its ok for relaxation not the right place","The best part about the hotel is that it’s a beach facing property. The restaurants and some of the rooms have a clear sea view and with wind blowing through the palm trees, it’s a pretty sight and almost makes up for the high rates they charge you. However, what was a little disappointing was that the hotel needs renovation. They have worked on the lobby and the restaurants; however once u go up towards the room areas, u realize that the place needs an uplift. The upholstery and furniture in the room is clean, yet it lacks the finesse of what is expected from a five star hotel and for the price u pay. The room size is small and the bathroom is even smaller. ","The property is located on Juhu Beach, which is awesome. The service at times is pathetic. The rooms need maintenance and house keeping was never prompt. Many of the facilities like swimming pool were just average. ",ProsStandard Novotel hotel as per their global standardGood location with beach access and access to mumbai northRooms are good with good amenities inside roomGood food and nice breakfast spreadVery cosy setup and comfortable Right pricing considering prime locationConsSlightly old property,"I was very disappointed. I came to celebrate Diwali in this hotel. Stayed 5 nights from 17th to 21st Oct 2017. No lights, no divas, no happy Diwali wishes, no decorations no sweeta nothing. Indians working in that hotel should be ashamed of themselves not to celebrate Diwali. I had to change the room very next day with the issues of shower. Staff very polite but management had no idea of guest relationship. Sorry but never again I will stay in this hotel. I would rate it as 3 star only."
