"Worst room I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world - for a so-called five star hotel. Terrible check in processes. Most unwelcoming staff. But for their location, they have nothing to recommend. Will never stay there again.",The property is wonderful and you will get the proper four seasons hospitality you would expect to get at any hotel within that exceptional chain. The lady at the concierge was very helpful with all the planning and she was very thoughtful to give my friend and I an Indian scarf that we can wear with our Kurtas. The rooftop terrace is a must visit at sunset! ,Was here for business for 2 weeks and the staff make you feel at home and are very lovely to speak to and always ask if they can help you and do more for you. I love the surprise gifts I would find in my room every couple of days especially when it was Diwali I loved that we got to experience and celebrate this festival with them.,"Our driver drove us from our Taj Hotel to the Four Seasons. In the three weeks in India this was the most thrilling place we experienced as far as a modern venue. The hotel is amazing and riding the elevator is a piece of theater. From the landing you still have to climb a couple of sets of stairs all adding to the fun of finally ARRIVING at the Lounge. What a view and what a beautifully designed space. While we were there it happened that there was a ban on alcohol, no matter! We had the flatbread pizza and a dessert. Wonderful. All the young people on staff were engaging which added to the fun of being on the top of Mumbai. BTW we are 71 and 73 years old and the bar is not just for youngsters to enjoy!!!","I was not expecting my stay at the Four Seasons in Mumbai to be anything special, but the personal service at this Hotel was brilliant. I dont think I have ever been to another hotel around the world, where the staff were completely attentive to your needs and where numerous levels of staff knew your name and used it in a welcoming manner.","What a great hotel, staff is extremely friendly, a very warm welcome. The room was nice, especially the bed. Very comfortable and we enjoyed the swimming pool very much. The rooftop bar is amazing, unfortunately they canâ€™t serve alcohol anymore due to some new policies in Mumbai. However it was a very pleasant stay. ","It was the one of the best Hotel we stayed in during our trip to Hong Kong, Singapore and Goa. Fantastic customer service experience during our stay, so much so that I cancelled my bother's hotel that he booked in Mumbai so I can book him and his family in to 4 Season.","Best hotel I have every been in to!! Perfect People, Perfect rooms and Perfect food. Have been there for only 2 nights, but cannot deny that the hotel made a big impression on me and the other members of our group","Awesome Hotel, Professional staff and with a warm hospitable attitude and feel. Very Pro-active approach to needs and requests. Front Desk Stars Karthik & Aditiya. WC must cater to Asian/ Indian guests","Random People landed up to our room without any access to our room or floor
and the hotel staff til date does not know how this happened
We ere highly disappointed with the security arrangements at the hotel"
