"Great hostel with private room. Located very close train station, bars and tourist attractions. Check in was one of the friendliest and most straight forward I had in India. Room was immaculate. Incredibly clean and the cleanest room I stayed in whilst travelling. Shower was basic but straightforward and got the job done. Staff offered a personal tour of Mumbai which was a nice touch. Has a rooftop common area but I didn’t see anyone else up there. ","I stayed for 2 nights here back in October 2012. The rooms were ok, very basic and suitable for backpackers which is what I expected so nothing to complain about here. However, just to warn you not to pre-book any bus or train travel connecting in another city with these guys as I paid them to get on a bus from Delhi to Agra. The bus never turned up in the stated location in Delhi so I was left stranded in the dark morning hours and in the end, I had to hire a cab to Agra! ","I only slept one night in this hostel but i would definitely recommend it! It is a basic hostel and I paid 700 rupees for a night in a mixed dorm. Breakfast was not included. Good wifi connection, even in my room. Location is perfect. It was closeby/ walking distance to the trainstation, markets/ bazaars, the musea and the gateway of India. It was safe to walk alone in the evening (even as single woman). The people were friendly, i was allowed to leave my luggage behind during the day, as I had an evening flight. I could even take a shower in the afternoon (after my check out). Good option to go to this hostel! ","This is THE place to stay at!I have never experienced a hotel with staff caring so much about their guests. They provide their guests with anything you ask for and answer any questions you have. They have tours around the city, I did the slum tour and it was an insighful and amazing experience. The staff make you feel more than welcome. The manager and his wife also working at the hotel even invited me to their house for a dinner. That's how friendly they are!!!!Top three:- Wifi! Fast and never lost its connection.- Location! The location is THE BEST. South Mumbai, but not in the crazy chaotic streets. It's calm, nice and safe. And walking distance to tourist attractions such as the gateway of india. - The room! The room is big, fresh (for being india) and really really nice! Don't miss out! Book your stay at Travellers Inn!",Conveniently located in Fort area.. very near to CST in case you have to catch a train from there.. it is the best place to stay.. lots of options for food nearby. taxis are easily available. Rooms and bathroom ar basic but clean. Staff is good. Mohit is very friendly and helpful. Had a great day stay there before catching our train to Aurangabad.,"Clean, convenient, friendly staff. Above all value for money.
Admidst the city. Gateway of India, Colaba market, fashion street... all are nearby.
Marine drive just 10 mins away.
Total VFM. Very economical. Owners are too good.","This was my third stay at Traveller´s, for so many good reasons. The rooms are fairly priced for Mumbai, comfortingly clean and quiet (things we learned not to take for granted in hotels in India!). The location is exccellent, with the Gateway, Colaba and Churchgate within walking distance, and a great array of restaurants and shops nearby. All staff are well-mannered and professional.However, what gives Traveller´s that precious extra value is no doubt THE SERVICE. It is easy to underestimate how tricky or time-consuming getting things done can be in Mumbai if you don´t know HOW. Especially for those new to India, anything from finding a working ATM, to changing money, to getting your phone repaired or choosing a place to eat or a worthwhile tour can become a frustrating half-day wander. Managers Mohit and Neal helped us out with all this and so much more, and were happy to share their knowledge and listen to our problems. The welcoming spirit with which they do so is touching, as we discovered when Mohit invited us over to his home for the Hindu celebration of Sri Ganesh darshan (Sri Ganesh festival, end of August). Things can go quite wrong in India, and when they do it´s the quality of service that makes all the difference. We were at Traveller´s during the devastating rains that flooded and blocked all of Mumbai at the end of August. Mohit and Neal were constantly at hand, updating us and trying to help us find a way to get to the airport for our flight out, going well beyond the call of duty as we had checked out hours before. I suspect it is this mix of hard work, know-how and genuine care that has made them one of the most sought-after hostel options in Mumbai, and they well deserve it. Give them a try, I would be surprised if you were disappointed.",1. Tryng very hard to contact them to change eaarlier booking. No results. 2. Came there as agreed in the morning. they wanted me to wait till afternoon to get the room in a empty hotel. 3. Zero contact with recepcionist. 4.As I claim bad reception they were pretending that it must be another restaurant in Bombaj no0t they. Hotel in Hinglish mean restaurant not hotel. Althogh I love this cultoral differenties never will go back to travellers Inn.,"Very nice clean place to stay, situated in the old city centre, 10 minutes walk from the gates of India) We were happy to stay there, were surprised by the quality-good prices for Mumbai. Stuff was very nice! The owner, Mohed, as well as other crew, very very hospital, it was a pleasure to stay in this hotel. The rooms vere very clean, with hot water, soap, TV etc. The roof top is cousy- with sofa's, tables and a boiler with filtered water.","A basic hotel but they have everything what we needed. It is centrally located, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff was really friendly and helpful, so they just make us feel like at home."
