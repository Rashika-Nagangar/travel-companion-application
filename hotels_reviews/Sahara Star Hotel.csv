"Near to airport, But supporting staff not so supportive .. Be ready to carry your luggage to your room as nobody will be there to show your room ,breakfast and dinner is just above average. Even though variety is there in breakfast taste is oridinary. Too much of crowd because of conferences conducted there.Even one instance we went to room then found out that magnetic key was working.. Again went to front desk to reactivate the key",I attended my cousins product launch / Birthday party earlier this month.. Food and banqueting facilities were amazing..
