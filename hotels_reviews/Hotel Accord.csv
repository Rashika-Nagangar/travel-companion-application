"Our flight was delayed for a number of hours but the hotel transfer proved very reliable. The hotel is located in close proximity to the airport which made for a simple arrival and departure. Hotel staff were welcoming and helpful. Assistance/translating to acquire a SIM card and ordering OLA Taxis (the Indian Uber equivalent) was provided. The breakfast served on rooftop terrace were varied from day to day with traditional Indian choices, including omelettes and fresh fruit juice. The rooms are relatively spacious and clean. We felt secure and safe in this hotel.Having traveled a lot internationally this hotel may seem very basic to some western travellers. Inexpensive furnishing and finishes and some wear and tear are a part of the package. The neighbourhood is full of a population who are going about their lives. No sidewalks, crazy traffic and all sorts of bustling humanity. None of the hustling that one can experience in the Old City tourist centres of some large cities. We ate some delicious, simple vegetarian meals in unassuming nearby restaurants. Zomato is a good review app for dining options. ","We stayed in the Accord for a family getaway to see a bit more of Mumbai. The hotel was nice and comfortable. I booked it through OYO. It is a bit away from the main attractions of Mumbai, but close to the airport. The room I had was nice though a bit of a squeeze with an extra bed(We were 3 of us), but we were happy to manage as the room was neat and had the clean bathroom. Food was served in the room on order by friendly staff members.Breakfast was included and they had a changing menu which was reasonably nice. The Staff handling breakfast were a bit stiff-lipped, though.","I stayed with the hotel for 12 days , It was an amazing experience, staff were great ... We had no complaints and it was so nice of them to celebrate Diwali with us ... Rooms are Neat and tidy and staff are very friendly...","De ""deluxe"" room is not ""deluxe"" at all. Don't trust the photos. They didn't pick me up at the airport although I sent them 4 e-mails. They don't clean the room if you don't leave the key at reception, which is weird. Lack of variety for breakfast. Average and comfortable room. Good location.","I am impressed by the ambience and hospitality. They taken utmost care from reception at the arrival of Mumbai Airport. All staffs are helpful and supportive. complimentary break fast is satisfactory, It is nearer to Santacruz station and domestic as well as International Airport. Juhu Beach is only 3 Km. but far from the Gateway of India (nearly 30 Km). I strongly recommended the hotel for family trips.","Excellent for the value collected, compared to the market value for the same size of accommodation in a metropolitan city. Surely recommended to persons who are travelling to Mumbai on personal expenses","We stayed in eco room for 2 nights. Rooms are old but they renovated it and it looks good. It's very close to the domestic airport and Santa Cruz Railway Station. Breakfast buffet at the terrace is average and they have set menu for all weeks day. Thought they have very limited things in bfast but it's yummy. Room service, Wi-Fi etc are good. They also provide free pickup from airport. Overall good stay in limited budget. ","The hotel is undergoing renovation, it may be of inconvenience to some guests but it is very conveniently located near the airport. The food was awesome. They provide free airport drop and pick up. Value for money hotel for a break journey",The hotel was booked by my office people but for the four days I stayed in Mumbai I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel staff were polite and caring. The rooms were cleaned everyday. The room - even though a bit small for my taste - was nicely decorated and had all the amenities one could think of. Another major advantage is that it is only 3 kms from the Airport and stone's throw from Santa Cruz (E) station and Western Expressway making it highly advantageous for Mumbai travels. The station road gives access to various shops and eating places. So you don't have to solely rely on hotel food. Easy accessibility and good rooms makes this hotel much recommended. But I would not recommend it for family stay as it is mostly frequented by business travellers and foreign tourists.,"The hotel is a 15 minute drive from the domestic as well as the International Airport.It is a small hotel with smaller rooms.Bathroom was very average.Hotel needs a makeover real soon.There was a stink in the hotel.We reached midnight and still the check in was smooth.Went there only for 7 hours just to sleep,so can't write much but the bed was okay and the breakfast was served in the room which was quite tasty.Other than that,not much to write about this hotel.Not worth 3500/- a night!Can be avoided as there are other options for same price available in Bandra and Santa Cruz/Vile Parle.Will I go back?No is the answer."
