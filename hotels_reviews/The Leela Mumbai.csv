From the minute I checked in until the day I checked out, I received superb service from the front desk!My room was always cleaned to a very high standard!Food was great in this hotel.I had a great experience at this hotel. It was my first time but I would highly recommend it and look forward in visiting in the future.","Breakfast and Sunday Brunch was amazing at Citrus. Champagne buffet is the way to go. Food is excellent....amuse bouche is fabulous in this restaurant. So many exciting things to see and taste. Service is excellent ! Rohit, great service! ",I enjoyed my 2nd time stay at The Leela as expected; hotel with high standard and very friendly staff starting from the picking up service from the airport till the last moment of my stay. highly recommended.,"This isn't my first visit to The Leela, and it won't be my last. The service is exceptional; from the time I'm picked up at the airport, to the time I depart. Everyone working there aims to please and is truly genuine. Quick check in on the 8th floor. Lovely breakfast in the morning; the manager at Jamavar more than happy to make some special meals for my little one. Can't think of a single thing to complain about. If the Leela keeps this up, I won't even bother looking online for a different place to try.","Since we had a 3am flight we decided to stay close to the airport. This is a perfect choice. After hours of traffic, honking horns and to much Indian food this was a peaceful end to a good trip. The pool is large and plenty of service and shade. We had lunch by the pool, a welcome salad. Then went to the spa for a great massage.We met in the lobby bar had a drink then enjoyed an Italian dinner on the top floor. The rooms were well appointed, large shower and bath tub. We slept for a few hours and then the hotel offered a transfer to the airport just 5 minutes away. ","Excellent service from the time you arrive at airport all the way you leave back. Service is always very consistent form Chauffeurs, Door man, Bell desk , Receptions staff, Lobby staff and staff at the eighth floor reception/Lounge. Food is very good at restaurant with many varieties and staff are very attentive and friendly as well. Room serve again very good.Hotel, rooms and washrooms are luxurious and Leela always have great properties. Probably I have stayed with Leela Mumbai for more than 60 times in all these years and always felt as my second home.Only thing I would expect is in some rooms power points near the bed/night lamp.",It’s a great hotel to be in. And everything is just more than perfect. Can’t expect more than this. It’s value for money. Service and all the help I got is just out of my imagination. I can’t see my self in any other hotel than this one. ,"Service quality is excellent, as usual. Warm people, from the person who meets you and greets you at the airport to the person who drops you back at the airport. Tasty food! Overall, a pleasant experience.","From the moment your representative greets you as you come out of the arrival halluntil the time that your driver takes one back to the airport, you don't have to think, all your requirements are anticipated by your wonderful staffthe concierge staff are so welcoming and your 8th floor reception make checking in so fast and easy. the rooms and the hotel facilities are excellent, but for me it is your staff especially, who make my stays such a pleasurable experience. I always look forward to staying at the Leela","I just love this place. Every time I travel to Mumbai, I make it a point to stay at The Leela. This is one of the best luxury hotels. Very courteous staff, very accommodating ... as it is said that Indian are best at hospitality, The Leela is THE best."
