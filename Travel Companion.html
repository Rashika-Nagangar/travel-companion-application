  [u&#39;My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant. I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant. They made me feel like family.If you visit the restaurant on the weekend, live music, featuring traditional Indian music, will add to your dining experience, as it did for me.&#39;,
   u&#34;The food and ambience here is really nice and its a great way to experience real Indian food and at the same time make sure that you won&#39;t suffer from any stomach issues. We had the large tasting menu and all dishes were of very high quality. 1 advice: stay away from the paan (bethel leave sweet)&#34;,
   u&#39;We arrived at this restaurant and were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. The service was prompt and the menu explained in detail by Azad who continued to serve us throughout the meal. The food was delicious and was served in copper plates that are traditional to the Royal classes of India. On two occasions through our very tasty meal Purvesh (the chef) came over to ask if his cooking was to our liking! Fully recommend this beautiful restaurant and special thanks to Azad and Purvesh who really went the extra mile to ensure our visit was something to remember. Absolutely brilliant. &#39;,
   u&#39;Had dinner at Nawab saheb - this is an Indian restaurant located within the Renaissance Hotel at Powai. The restaurant is well furnished with tall ceilings and nice decor. They have live Indian music in the evenings with a good singer - we started our dinner at around 7 15 PM and had the restaurant and the singing all to our selves. By 8:30 the restaurant started filling up - seems to be quite popular - the food was exceptional - we went for the set meal, one Vegetarian and the other non vegetarian - this comes with a set of unlimited starters. the non vegetarian had 2 types of chicken, one fish and two lamb starters - all of them were superb. The main course was also good but we were already full with the starters. The desert options were also huge - overall a great experience with great food and soothing music. &#39;,
   u&#39;The set menu is a fantastic way to experience a number of different dishes. Presented beautifully, and in a lovely environment, it was a great introduction for me to traditional North Indian dishes. I\u2019m used to South Indian food, and was pleased to get some tips on how a couple of the fish dishes were prepared. Looking forward to another night here, for sure!&#39;,
   u&#39;I have visited most of the fine dine restaurants. the consistency is appreciated. Chef Younus is one of the finest chefs in the country. Kudos&#39;,
   u&#34;Whenever I have a strong craving for good north indian or punjabi food, Nawab Sahab is the place I visit. It&#39;s is really disappointing to be in mumbai if you love good, spicy and rich north indian food because most of the places here are serving food with gujrati or south indian food flavours and forget authenticity, but this is one place where you feel like you are enjoying your food in Delhi restaurant. Dal Lakhani &amp; Deserts are to die for.&#34;,
   u&#39;The whole experience was royal, good ambience and enjoyed lovely live Ghazals on Saturday with Dinner booked thru Eatigo. Opted for set meals which provide a range of options from Non veg, Sea food as well as Mix and Match. The appetizers were well succulent and delicious in taste and served with a lot of interest and patience which added a notch to the eating experience. The mains were equally well prepared and went well with the garlic nans and laccha parathas. The wide desert spread had something for everyone from fresh fruits, indian sweets like gulab jamuns, ras malai and also ice cream. The staff were immaculate in their service and special thanks to &#34;Jayshree&#34; and team to help make this a memorable dining experience. Strongly recommended if you are a food lover and would like to relish a lavish indian spread + great service.&#39;,
   u&#39;Lovely ambience. Lovely hospitality. Jayshree. Very careing. Very delicious and light food They entire team including the chef is very careing hospitable . I love this place and would recommend people to come here to have a lovely candle light dinner. &#39;,
   u&#39;This one is worth the visit since the food is very very tasty and it is also service oriented one.rates are manageable&#39;,

  [u&#39;So I was here on a Saturday night, for a special occasion and I must say this was the right choice we made when it came to Italian cuisine. From the moment we entered, to dining and leaving the restaurant, we were taken well care of.Our server Alrina, greeted &amp; served us with warmth despite the customizations we made to the menu. But the best we tried was the Lamb carpaccio, Lasagne, Panna cotta and Pepperoni pizza. Would love to be back here.&#39;,
   u&#39;I was there after long day of travelling. Service was very good. As if they waited just for me. Took an amazing Borata, and the lamb with Rissoto. The lamb dish was nice. I was expecting the lamb to be more tender as it says Osobuco style. But still it was tasety. The Tiramisu was great! I will come back there. &#39;,
   u&#39;Great food, great service, everything outstanding. Special thanks to chef Roberto!!! Great evening!!!&#39;,
   u&#34;We visited Romano&#39;s for my best friend&#39;s birthday and Oh boy! what an experience...The restaurant is situated on the ground floor in JW Marriott near Mumbai&#39;s T2 Airport and serves Italian cuisines. As soon as you walk in you notice an amazing ambiance, open kitchen and a huge shelf of unimaginable types of wines. The place is nicely lit to give you a warm and welcoming feeling.We were escorted to our table by our cute little staff who helped us throughout. The staff is extremely good and also suggests for dish we should try out. We called for variety of food like Burrata, Chicken Tomato Soup, King Prawns, Fried Calamari, Pizza, Pasta, Lamb and Steamed Fish...all of it tantalized our taste buds and made us wanting for more.. Apparently the lamb that was served was from NZ and the fish was from Chile - They both were indeed very tasty and succulent.Out an out a must visit place when in Mumbai for fine dining and an experience that won&#39;t fade away quickly.Kudos to the team at Romano&#39;s!&#34;,
   u&#39;Food was tasty. Spread was good too. Options for breakfast was very good. I felt it was little expensive however, food was very tasty.&#39;,
   u&#34;I live in NYC metro area so I have access to outstanding Italian restaurants. This has been my second visit to Mumbai and have been totally surprised that you could find such an outstanding Italian restaurant that compares to any in NYC in India. Service- Outstanding- Ashuli and her team provide a very Friendly and knowledgeable staff. The go out of their way to ensure everything is perfectChef- Roberto comes out and makes makes recommendations and follow&#39;s up on your your dinner.Food- I have had dined there over 5 times in the couple of weeks i was there and everyone one has been excellent. The Burrata -amazing, Pizza- excellent. I will be traveling to Mumbai every few months and this will be on my must list for dining.&#34;,
   u&#34;I recently stayed at JW Marriott Sahar and I tried Romano&#39;s. It was excellent and truly authentic Italian (and I&#39;m originally from Italy)! The whole dinner was scrumptious with Carbonara at the top of the chart! It was one of the best carbonara I&#39;ve ever had!5 stars, no doubt, for ambiance, decor, service and I wish I could give more stars to Chef Roberto Zorzoli.&#34;,
   u&#39;Your one stop shop for the finest Italian fare in the city and possibly even the country. Rustic, authentic and plush come together in an ambient surrounding. Great food, outstanding service and truly a memorable experience. What\u2019s best is the restaurant manager Ms. Ashuli who walks you through your meal and ensures you\u2019re always having a good time! Would definitely recommend. &#39;,
   u&#34;Been here for a business meet. Such a beautifully set place. Just the right ambience for a business meet, maybe a date or a family gathering. Tried various dishes and I must say that Chef Kalpesh, Chef Zela, Chef Sidhesh were are their best, and Chef Roberto is soo friendly with everyone that it feels comfortable.Coming to the service at Romano&#39;s.. It&#39;s the best I have ever got till now.. Mr. Melroy and Ms. Ashuli are the best managers I have met till date.. And Mr.Partha with his team Pratik,Alrina,Baby,Avlon,Vishnu,Dhaval,Sandesh and Kim.... All these guyzzz are really really amazing... They are soo prompt at their service makes one feel really relaxed and happy as well!! Wil surely visit this place again.Kudos to all these guyz to make the business meet into a wonderful dine out!!&#34;,
   u&#34;The staff at Romano&#39;s is extremely courteous. It was my mothers birthday last week and I had decided to surprise her by taking her for dinner to Romano&#39;s. The Restaurant Assistant Manager, Mr. Partha made sure everything was set and made perfect for her. My mother was asked to choose a table for herself, Miss Baby walked us to our table and was sweet enough to appreciate my mother for her selection. Miss Alrina Dsouza was the associate that helped my mother be at ease and helped her with her choice of food and beverage. Miss Kim made sure that our table was crumble free and that we had a clean set of plates and cutlery after every course. Mr. Partha made sure to come and check on us at frequent intervals and made sure that we were comfortable and that we had a great time. Romano&#39;s is the place to be at when one wishes to be treated royally. They&#39;ll make sure that the guests have nothing to complain about. They&#39;ll do more than what&#39;s asked of them to make sure the guest leaves the restaurant with a smile on his/her face. And not to mention, they were damn sweet to get us a complimentary pizza. Love and Best wishes to the entire team. Thank you for making this birthday a special one. P.S My mother loved the Berry Ice tea, Polpette and the salmon steak. The tiramisu at Romano&#39;s is to die for . I&#39;d recommend Romano&#39;s to anyone and everyone. It is THE place to be at when you want to pamper yourself with some delicious food and beverages.&#34;,

  [u&#39;I stayed at \u201ethe orchid\u201c hotel in Mumbai and went for dinner to the roof top restaurant. It was Halloween night and a special setting. The view is spectacular. I had a great mocktail and a really delicious Indian vegetarian main course. But what I can mostly recommend is dessert. Try the home made ice cream. So yummy. But the best of all is the very nice and helpful waiters. Especially Tushar. He is so funny and nice. I really enjoyed my time here and would definitely eat here again. &#39;,
   u&#39;Had a spooky evening at Mostly Grills Today. The guy at the entrance gave me goosebumps. It was indeed an epic Halloween ambience with superb decor. The food was great. The service was exceptionally high on standards. The staff is courteous and well trained. Special thanks to Manager Anush, Samuel, Tushar Parth for making my evening a memorable one. Thank you Team Mostly Grills&#39;,
   u&#34;good services and mankind.\nespecially mr.tushar is really nice and serving good!! you should come here!!\nand in addition, it&#39;s nice music and woman.&#34;,
   u&#39;best restaurant, very good staff and good taste to it and very well food at night to also and thats very good experience to our couples to it&#39;,
   u&#39;Came here on way back from a business trip in Mumbai, read the reviews and sounded good, safe to say not disappointed. I had the tandoori lobster, it was delicious. It\u2019s also conveniently close to the international airport so a nice place to eat and have a beer before a flight... highly recommended&#39;,
   u&#39;very helpfull staff . samjad chef , naresh chef , maxwell , kanaiya chef &amp; manager ajush are very good \U0001f64f&#39;,
   u&#39;After three whirlwind weeks all over India, I overlook the airport on my last night, no more groups or itinerary. I review my time and look forward to my next journey enjoying a snack and the wonderful service by Tushar at Mostly Grilled. Thank you for wrapping up my beautiful visit here on a high note!&#39;,
   u&#39;Great place... Superb ambiance. Service is excellent. Refreshing aroma as you enter the hotel. The staff is presentable and politely special mention to Priyanka and Anush.Enjoyed the food. Perfectly crafted by chef. Will visit again and again.&#39;,
   u&#39;October fest was going on when i went. Drinks were really expensive for a empty bar. The bar was completely empty and the ambience is a disaster.&#39;,
   u&#39;Unfortunately I was having dinner at night time so I could not enjoy the views, only the distant noise and airport lights.\nVaried menu and friendly staff.&#39;,

  [u&#34;Tried some awesome breakfast at the Peshwa, ITC Maratha. Since I was alone I couldn&#39;t taste many of the things I would have liked to so chose to try the signature breakfast dishes, and what a good decision that turned out to be! I tried the silky pearl millet custard with coconut milk, buckwheat cinnamon roll, eggs Benedict and some herbed rice with chicken stroganoff. All were delightful. The Sr. Sous Chef, Jayesh and the patisserie chef Bhavesh indulged my culinary enthusiasm by answering my questions about their craft.&#34;,
   u&#34;The more I eat at the Pavilion, the more annoyed I become about the service. So this is going to be a bit of a complaint/negative review, even though the food is pretty tasty and having a lot of variety. Had I eaten at the restaurant only a few times, these might not have stood out as issues, but because I&#39;m eating there multiple times per week, I have started to see trends that bother me.Some of the issues I take with the service at the restaurant include:* Being seated at a table with food crumbs on the chairs.* Having to ask for butter at breakfast half of the time. The other half of the time they have butter waiting on the table. * Being asked if I want coffee by the hostess, and then having to ask a waiter to bring it. Sometimes the coffee comes, sometimes I have to ask.* Having to ask every single time for a refill on coffee or house water. They never proactively ask me if I want more, even when my cup is empty.* Waiters are too eager to clear plates. Often times, seconds after I put the fork down, a waiter asks if they can clear the plate. Why are they so focused on plate removal but are blind to the need for more coffee or water?* Being served compulsory starters at a buffet (lunch and dinner). This is something that just confuses me greatly. A buffet is about choice. Why do servers automatically deliver items to my table that I didn&#39;t ask for? When I eat at a buffet, I want the foods I want, not what they want for me. I know they are included in the buffet, but allow me to ask for them, or give me a choice. Or put those foods on the buffet line itself! Food is wasted when its delivered to me and I don&#39;t want it. Why the starters and not, for example, Indian breads? Indian breads are included in the buffet and made to order, but they never deliver them automatically - they ask me first, and I&#39;ve always said no.* Being charged for something I didn&#39;t have. The lunch buffet includes beverages, but there is a line item charge for it on the check (buffet for one price, beverages for another price). I only drink water at lunch, so I declined beverages, and they still charged for me it. I complained to the waiter, but he said they had to break it out on the bill due to GST calculations. Whatever their reasons are, I find it frustrating to see charges for beverages that I didn&#39;t have.* Blind devotion to service as trained and not towards what the guest needs. In a hospitality setting, it is all about the guest, but I often feel I am participating in a tightly choreographed play where waiters do exactly as their are told/trained and are not aware of what a guest needs. They also ask too many questions for my preference. Often times at a meal, 5 or more staff members come to my table, ask me how I&#39;m doing, if I need anything. Do I want Indian bread? Do I need anything? Is the food good? Am I having a nice stay at the hotel? It was charming at first, but having stayed at the hotel for some time, its starting to bother me.My advise to the team would be, if a guests asks you 4 times in a meal for a refill of coffee, start watching me to see if I need a refill. I would rather you tailor your service in this way rather than go according to the playbook, like asking me if I want Indian breads when my coffee cup is almost empty.&#34;,
   u&#39;Good restaurant with good spread of buffet. Enjoyed everything, will surely visit again. Must say have witnessed a gr8 service.&#39;,
   u&#39;Ambience so relaxing though you are just outside the busy international airport.\nwas there with friends from dubai and new Zealand. an informal business lunch. my guests loved the place returned for dinner too&#39;,
   u&#39;Usually when you are away from home, you expect little extra care. Shreya bhate has been very friendly. She has been closely observing when I order tea. After few days, I didn\u2019t have to order TEA. She will serve on right time. On my fasting\xa0day, she showed concern about my meal &amp; packed frits for me. Shreya bhate has caring nature that is an asset to Service Industry. My best wishes for Shreya bhate. Thanks for taking good care of me.&#39;,
   u&#39;The wide and sumptuous breakfast served at Peshwa pavilion , coupled with a very refreshing natural daylight gushing in from the roof of the atrium makes a great start to a lovely day. Chef Kashi helps make it a delight with his special personalised attention and hospitality. &#39;,
   u&#39;My previous review was about the hotel. We dined at their other restaurants and the first was Peshwa Pavilion.As you enter, you are received and greeted by a polite lady who helps you with a table of your choice. Trust me, we changed three tables before we finally settled.The setup is magnificent with an amazing view up to the ceiling which is 5 floors above from where the sunlight lightens the entire restaurant. The architecture incorporates the Gate Way Of India and the Victoria Terminals.The food is as beautiful as its architecture. A wide array of dishes across cuisines. One can have anything of their choice. A little turn down was their biryani. We did not find it as interesting and tasty as it should have been. They do serve good deserts also. They have a great team which serves you exceptionally well.Final word - Recommended.&#39;,
   u&#39;What amazing food we have had here! Love! The prices are really affordable, too. Expect to pay between 800 - 1500 Rupees per meal (excl. tax).&#39;,
   u&#39;Their buffet offers top Indian dishes as well as some European cuisine. Apart from what is on display, they also offer additional items freshly prepared, such as yellow Dal, Rotis etc They also bring to your table a selection of starters. We stuck to Indian food and were not disappointed. The service is prompt and friendly. This restaurant is open 24 hours!&#39;,
   u&#39;Excellent. Always look forward to breakfast. All the hotel waiters are very friendly and helpful. Would also like to specially compliment one of them Sachin today. Took the trouble to explain what certain foods were and was helpful and friendly. He even took notice the timing I go down for breakfast daily -- attention to detail I must say.&#39;,

  [u&#39;I went to the restaurant with a friend of mine there for lunch.. The food and service provided was just excellent.. Umar and Rohit helped us from welcome drink to evening Coffee.. Thanks Umar and Rohit.. Looking forward to visit again.. \U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d&#39;,
   u&#39;Great from start to finish! Excellent!! Advised along the way and the buffet was perfect. Akshay and Siddesh couldn\u2019t have been more helpful.\U0001f600&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed here in Westin Mumbai Garden City for business and I had a dinner at this restaurant for dinner. I had an excellent service with the staff Rohit Kumar who helped me a lot at the dinner and provide me with all the caring I need. I love his service and attending to all the detail that I need. Thank you Rohit. &#39;,
   u&#39;Attentive and helpful service rendered by Associate Ujjwal Kumar. Ujjwal sees to every need and makes the breakfast an enjoyable experience.&#39;,
   u&#39;The days that I spent at the Westin were very nice.\nThe food as well as the service and the rooms are of very good quality.\nI strongly recommend.&#39;,
   u&#39;Special Thanks to Arvind kumar , Ujjwal kumar and vishal kolapte for their excellent service and also the birthday cake....also to mention the red velvet cake for delicious...with warm regards&#39;,
   u&#39;Another excellent evening buffet dinner at the Seasons in the Westin. Great selection of food from European to Asian. On the night I visited they had a stall specialising in Chaat Street food, thanks to Vishal Kalapte for explaining the concept and how it should be eaten. Taste was amazing. &#39;,
   u&#39;Had lunch today n loved the place alot really appreciate all the chefs for the lovely food n the staff for there hardwork especially Umar Shelia one of the best person there for a perfect lunch guidance and the hardwork motivated us also came for food n returned with alot of dedication n motivation towards work.Felt like Seasonal is lucky enough to have such great supporters.APPRECIATED!!! WILL B BACK SOON...&#39;,
   u&#39;Must try place. Amazing service by Mr. Vishal. He took really great care or what we want.. The taste of food is too good with wide spread. Want to have good time. Do visit&#39;,
   u&#34;Our server, Rishikesh Shinde, was super attentive during the entire time we were having our breakfast. He ensured our table was cleared of used cutlery whenever the opportunity arose. However, I hope the restaurant management would encourage their staff to only clear empty cups and/ or plates to reduce/ prevent wastage. Nonetheless, Rishikesh&#39;s (and his colleagues&#39;) warm demeanour would certainly be a plus point in considering to dine at Seasonal Tastes!&#34;,

  [u&#39;I arrived quite late and the hotel staff helped me secure dinner (despite the kitchen closing in less than 5 minutes). In particular, Subhankar was a great waiter. He made excellent recommendations given I had to order quickly and kept me company without ever imposing. Only in India and at the St Regis could I receive such thoughtful and caring service. Highly recommend the \u201cBy the Mekong Chicken\u201d \u2014 wonderful rich dish with moderate spice.Highly-recommend for business and romantic dinners. Great views of the south of Mumbai.&#39;,
   u&#39;Went back to By The Mekong after quite a while....It\u2019s got an amazing view and the food is to die for We had the edamame dim sim &amp; veg crystal dumpling for starters, both were very good. For mains the noodles &amp; mix vegetables were exotic, The green Thai curry was mellow and gelled very well with the noodlesThe hazelnuts cherry pastry was too goodArnold took very care of us and Siddhi, Uday &amp; Nemish were very prompt in serving us smilingly...Would highly recommend this place and would definitely go back....&#39;,
   u&#34;It&#39;s always best place to visit again and again. Food is amazing with excellent staff. The best Asian restaurant in Mumbai. The ambience is also good.&#34;,
   u&#34;I visited Mumbai to meet my best friend and he suggested that we go for Asian cuisine. I am honestly not a fan, but was convinced has he spoke highly of the place and the food. I would have really regretted if had turned him down. The restaurant is beautiful! It is located on the 37th floor and sea view is just mesmerising. The food too was a delight. We went for spinach wrapped chicken and Edamame truffle dumplings to begin with. The bbq&#39;d black pepper and kaffir lamb chops were to die for! And lastly we went for flaming mud cake - speechless about this one.All in all, I highly recommend this place as the food, ambience &amp; service are all beyond the mark. I am glad my friend took me here.&#34;,
   u&#39;Visited by the Mekong today and it was an amazing experience. Nice food with perfect ambience and staff...&#39;,
   u&#39;Most amazing dinner and dinner ever!!!\nSharique is the best waiter/man of India ever!\nCome to St Regis hotel and By the Mekong for the best time and top it off with Club Luna!!!&#39;,
   u&#34;Staying in my favourite Mumbai business hotel I have finally been able to try By The Mekong.This is an excellent place to try if you want absolutely first class Asian from a wide ranging menu in central Mumbai.With excellent views, plenty of room between tables for those intimate dinners or business conversations, superb service and some of the best Asian food I have tried anywhere in the world this location is unmissable.A great wine list compliments the offering.I did mention to the manager that I am still a little surprised in travels in Mumbai restaurants that with the extraordinary quality now of first class locations such as this that they still insist on serving automatic machine coffee. It must only be a matter of time before the trend in the rest of the world to cap off a great meal with barista quality caffeine arrives in India&#39;s financial capital also !Still, this wonderful establishment is highly recommended&#34;,
   u&#39;Awesome food!!!Loved Every bit! Dimsums a must try\nSpecial thanks to chef Mahesh Kadam for recommendation\nand for super meal.Do try Mud cake for the dessert.&#39;,
   u&#34;By the mekong serves superb food and has very lovely ambience....... one must visit dis place..it&#39;s in palladium mall... the service was quite nice and great staff......................had a great time here...surely goin to visit this place again....&#34;,

  [u&#39;Shree Thaker Bhojnalaya is famous Gujrati food destination in Kalbadevi-Girgaon areas of Mumbai. It offers authentic Gujrati fare from ages and remains the thali legend.&#39;,
   u&#39;Amazing restaurant, were able to tase 33 different small dishes for only 500r incl tax water and service charge. The owner explained every spice and dish. It was absolutely amazing definitely the very best restaurant in whole mumbai if you love to taste the enormous variation of the Indian kitchen. Definitely would visit again!&#39;,
   u&#39;This restaurant is truly a highlight because of the amazing staff, especially Mr. Gotham, who took so much care on us. The food is absolutely delicious and you get an all-you-can-eat 19 course comprising dinner for 500 INR including buttermilk and mineral water. Every single course is explained - the ingredients, the way how to eat it and you get answers to all of your questions. Brillant for food loving tourists like us. They even use mineral water to make sure that foreigners do not have any issues with the food. Strong recommendation!&#39;,
   u&#39;Superb food specially for gujrati... samosa was yumm over here... thali is famous ... enjoyed with family a lott&#39;,
   u&#39;Thakar is popular for its indian dishes. They maintain good quality and hygiene. Ambience and staff is also good. V good service. Excellent.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shree Thaker Bhojanalay is a truly amazing Gujarati Thali experience. The sober and local atmosphere of the place, the magical spices, the outstanding service, the quality of the ingredientes; definitely a place to visit solo or in group. I visited by myself and the guy in charge of the service was so keen and patient on explaining me every single spice and how to try and combine every different plate. He spoke great English and made me feel very welcomed. I was even offered a ride back to the station as taxis were super hard to find at that time of the day. Will definitely come back as soon as I return to Mumbai. My recommendation would be to arrive with a very BIG appetite. Lunch time would be better as the meal is pretty huge and if you are not used to thali you\u2019ll need some hours to digest.&#39;,
   u&#39;Shree Thaker Bhojnalay - a restaurant that serves gujrati style thali, which is basically all you can eat menu consisting of different variety of dishes from the cuisine, from starters to desserts. The restaurant is located on Dadyseth Agiary Lane just off Kalbadevi Road and finding the same can be a little difficult task. The area is very congested and does not any space available for parking, so its best to walk down to the restaurant. 2 wheelers can be parked outside the restaurant, provided you get an empty space.The restaurant is located on 1st floor. Its an indoor seating area and the entry seems quite congested. The dining area of the restaurant is not that big, with around 15-20 tables in the whole place. Sometimes, it may happen that you have to share a big table with other people. The restaurant is generally crowded, so a waiting time of 15-20 mins can be expected. They have a small plank to sit, outside the restaurant for people to wait.The staff here is very polite and courteous. After taking down our names for the waiting list, he informed that we need to wait for sometime and he himself came to the waiting area and took us to our table. The moment we sat down, we were served cold water. The best part of the place is that everyone here gets mineral water and its not charged separately.The farsan consisted of dhokla, moong bhaji, fried papad and salad, with green chutney and imli chutney along with the farsan.In vegetables, they had 5 sabji\u2019s \u2013 Bhindi, Aloo mutter, Chanda dal, palak and paneer. The paneer and palak were tasty, whereas other vegetables were ok. Dal and kadhi were offered in sweet Gujju style and non sweet. Rotis included phulka, jawar bhakri, puri and the traditional Gujju style small puran poli, which was drenched in ghee. The phulka\u2019s are drenched in ghee and served hot, so you end up eating quite a lot than you should. To end the mains, we could choose from steamed rice and khichadi. In sweets there was Fruit salad, moong dal halwa and a Bengali sweet. The fruit salad was way too sweet however the Bengali sweet was amazing. Also they keep on serving Chaas, which is really helpful to digest the food. Unlike some other thali eateries, there were no restrictions on the servingsThe only negative of the place is that the price of the thali is Rs. 500 on normal days and Rs. 600 on weekends and holidays, which is quite high considering the variety of food being served.Note:1) Cost for 2 people \u2013 Rs. 10002) Waiting time of 15-20 mins, depending on the day of the week.\u2003&#39;,
   u&#39;The place is small and cozy. Serves rich quality food at affordable rates. I have visited this place and simply loved the way your thali is decorated and different items are placed in front of you.It is said that food must not only taste good but look good. This place fulfills both the criteria.&#39;,
   u&#34;Overhyped. Good but not worth the effort of locating it. Many easier alternatives that are just as good. No plans to return I&#39;m afraid.&#34;,
   u&#34;I couldn&#39;t find the restaurant; following the direction by gps.\nPlease provide more direction to store&#34;,

  [u&#39;This place never ceases to amaze. The ambiance, service, knowledge of the waiters and above all the quality of their food is faultless. The restaurant was almost full (we arrived around 9 pm) - glad we had made a reservation. We were immediately sat at our table. The service was quick and friendly. We went with the waiter\u2019s suggestions from the menu and the food was simply stunning. A trip to Mumbai wouldn\u2019t be complete without a visit to Peshawri!&#39;,
   u&#34;Came late on a Tuesday evening for a meal with work colleagues. The food is amazing - you have to try the speciality lamb dish, the meat just falls off the bone and tastes so good.Probably some of the best Indian food i&#39;ve ever eaten.Great to also watch the chef&#39;s preparing the food in the glass fronted kitchen.&#34;,
   u&#39;This restaurant will lure the occasional meat eater to become a full blown carnivore. The Raan is the highlight. As is the Dal. Those two jewels alone are enough to make a person visit this place again and again! :-)&#39;,
   u&#39;This is the Mumbai colleague of Bukahra in Delhi - which is one of the most famous restaurants in India. It lives up to the same consistent quality &amp; freshness of the tandoori grilled meats &amp; especially the dal. It is in ITC 5 star hotel - it is not meant to be cheap so if you think on this level you are in the wrong place. Great service &amp; ambience.&#39;,
   u&#39;ok, the food is ok. It is well cooked and prepared, but nothing that spectacular. The normal street food restaurant will get similar results. Mostly the ordinary restaurants will be better spiced.But then the rip-off starts. You have to pay for PLAIN WATER !!! Roti for 60-100rupies per piece. And nothing special. You really only pay for the ambience. if you can avoid, then do so, or only consume the DAL thadarka without any drinks. Alt least the onions are free&#39;,
   u&#39;The place has a wide variety of mouth watering cuisines especially the mughlai food.The\xa0food, the\xa0service\xa0and the ambiance made it a great\xa0experience\xa0for us.&#39;,
   u&#39;One of the best restaurant i ever went, its near to mumbai airport and best peshavari food even i had here. Staff is good wel experience.\nIf u going there near by u guys need to visit them.&#39;,
   u&#39;Delicious palate to fill up your taste bud. The most authentic mughlai cuisine with wide variety of cuisine to choose from.&#39;,
   u&#39;Atmosphere maybe not the best, but the meals could not be faulted! Large portions of both chicken and lamb dishes (we shared!) and the Dal Bukhara with Naan probably the highlight!!&#39;,
   u&#39;Had a great dinner with nice staff and food to eat with fingers only. Not too spicy. Try different dishes to share. Don\u2019t forget raita!&#39;,

  [u&#39;I had been there with my friends, I must say great experience and mouth watering food. I have been to other 5 star properties to dine but somewhere i felt the warmth is missing and i strongly believe it is because of the staff we get great service, the lady who served us( steffi) pleasant and very humble nature with always a smile. Thank you for the great service. Kudos&#39;,
   u&#34;I&#39;m not a big fan of any other food other than Indian fare. But after visiting Cellini ,I realised that that was because I had not tasted the actual authentic fare. Being a vegetarian ,I thought that my choices would be limited,but it was not soFresh green salad with goat cheese accompanied by minestrone soup was very appealing to the palette. They offer freshly baked sourbread with an aubergine dip which is superb..This is on the house.. Then I had pizza with goats cheese and pesto sauce which was absolutely mouth watering served on a thinnest of crusts.. Will definitely visit again..&#34;,
   u&#34;Superb unapologetic Saturday brunch!!! Great Value for Money.To celebrate my son&#39;s birthday we decided to try this unique Italian brunch on Saturday. True to it&#39;s spirit they serve some real outstanding Italian food.Head Chef Allesendro personally looks after every guests requirement. Excellent Salad and cheese spread makes a nice beginning with unlimited pouring of wine. Those who eat only Vegetarian food always have limited choices in specialty restaurant but not here. We never felt short of choices in any of the courses.Pizza ,pasta and rissoto are made to order and served on the table .We tried veg pizza arabita with roasted garlic and goat cheese and mushroom risotto . They we&#39;re just awesome.Service is excellent ,live music adds to your mood of a lazy afternoon brunch.Desert spread was good but has some scope of improvement.If you want to enjoy excellent authentic Italian food and have a great treat guys go for it you will not be disappointed&#34;,
   u&#39;Had been to celini for their Saturday brunch with friends and boy weren\u2019t we so happy we chose celini.... the place itself is rocking with a live music band and awesome staff... we were assisted by Steffi Gomes, Darrell Fernandes and Savio Berneto from the service team... the service was quick, the servers made precise suggestions with regards to the menu and our every request was immediately fulfilled... and now let me come to the best part of our experience.... the \u201cFood\u201d , one can literally see the efforts put in presenting such amazing food as soon as you enter the restaurant. We were welcomed by an array of cold starters and salads as we entered celini... there are fresh breads to go along with an array of cold cuts, cheeses and innovative dressings to go along with the salads. Countless individual mini salads and hot food continue to add variety to the buffet...And to appreciate the man behind such amazing food , Chef.Alessandro.... he is a true humble magician... who puts all that love in he food that what makes it so visually appealing and also lip smacking .... Chef really makes sure all guests requests are catered to and there\u2019s no space left in your belly by the time you leave.... team celini thank you for the warm service and awesome memories.... Btw ... thank you for the special birthday cake surprise..... keep rocking Celini...!!!!!&#39;,
   u&#39;The restaurant is so good... it\u2019s hard to describe it over a full belly , The Italian these guys serve is like Heaven to me ... The staff is so Friendly and Courteous it makes me wanna come back for sure ... My experience with the food was mind blowing , Thanks to Darell and Savio my aunt and I had a wonderful experience and Chef Gustavo whose skill is Fantastico .... Thanks a lot u guys it was a pleasure dining at Celini ...&#39;,
   u&#39;Differentiated flavour , impeccable preparation and great service make this a great place for quick meetings and discussion . A leisurely weekend brunch could be enjoyed in the smattering of flavours dishes up by the chef . &#39;,
   u&#39;Excllent food Thanks to Chef Ganesh and his team for an exoctic food and Good service Service team very good and great job by everyone Steffy was very friendly and made us much more comfortable..&#39;,
   u&#39;Great restaurant with authentic Italian food and superior Indian service! Try the Diavola Pizza. Simply amazing. The staff is very attentive and always up for a quick chat. For dessert, I recommend the Tiramisu.&#39;,
   u&#39;The other day I came in for dinner with my wife . The menu was a real wide spread . Not forgetting the beetroot ravioli and lamb rack . Although the staff were pretty good at their service . Aaron took really good care of our table with amazing service and wonderful recommendations. Will visit soon\u270c&#39;,
   u&#34;If you are looking for authentic Italian food spread , this is the place you got to be. The brunch we went for was a perfect mix of a variety of appetizers , flavourful pastas , pizzas so so good , unlimited proseccos and the list goes on . There&#39;s also a fantastic live band and with the yummy cocktails flowing you are sure gonna have a good time .Great service from Aaron Fernandes , do ask for him , he will take excellent care of you . &#34;,
   u&#39;I had been there with my friends, I must say great experience and mouth watering food. I have been to other 5 star properties to dine but somewhere i felt the warmth is missing and i strongly believe it is because of the staff we get great service, the lady who served us( steffi) pleasant and very humble nature with always a smile. Thank you for the great service. Kudos&#39;,

  [u&#39;Beautiful ambiance with a uniqueness to the service will leave you literally speechless...simpler menu but ultimate treat to the taste buds...worth paying a visit..&#39;,
   u&#34;Visited this place for the first time and just loved it; the ambience, the sufficient lighting, delicious food, it&#39;s presentation and above all the friendly and smiling people who served us. Really liked all the non vegetarian dishes that we had ordered Prawns seekh tandoor, kheema ghotala, white pepper chicken, quail tandoor. The vegetarian platter could be improved. Especially the kothimbir vadi (this was a totally different version from anything that I&#39;ve had before). The dessert sugar-free sitaphal pannacotta was simply out of this world (photo attached). All in all a great place to chill with family and friends.&#34;,
   u&#34;Took one of my Mumbai teams for lunch on the 27th of Oct, 2017. This restaurant and it&#39;s sister (Madeira &amp; Mime) take social responsibility to the next level by hiring waitstaff and cooks who are deaf / mute and you need to use (Indian) sign language to communicate. No worries - the menu has the signs you need to order food and drinks. Baljeet our head-waiter was fantastic and she served my group of 20+ ever complaining professionals with a smile and the food shut them up :). If you are brave - go for the chicken lollipops flavored with ghost pepper. Paneer Seekh is not to be missed and you will curse yourself if you never tasted the Prawn Curry or the Rajma Chawal (yes - you read that right). Lastly, it is sacrilege to leave without having the faluda ...Overall the food was excellent, service was very friendly and efficient and the social IQ of the owners to employ those who are usually discarded by the wayside of Indian society and integrate them into highend dining is just exquisite - and you can see the happiness written across the face of the service staff and the kitchen hands. This is not a sad place - and it makes you happy too.Get there *early* and you will NOT regret it.&#34;,
   u&#39;We visited the restaurant on evening for dinner. We booked it in advance. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. The service and the food quality are both good. The price is reasonable.&#39;,
   u&#39;Sorry to say, but other than the thoughtfulness of hiring efficient staff, the food was average for the price. For a teetotaller, it could well be a miss..There are many more restaurants that serve better taste and ambience.Everything, like chicken dahi and angari chicken tasted sweetish..the onion, gobi brought to the table was neither pickled well nor had a dash of lime... serving size was just ok...service was super slow...suuuuppper slllowwww. Worst was sufiyani biryani..oh dat raw taste of mustard..and white raw chicken...worst biryani ever....my son vomitted...Roti were awesome...fresh and hot. Fish starters ok...expensive though. Staff sweet..&#39;,
   u&#39;Everyone is welcomed with a smile here, amazing food, and great services. I would recommend must visit this place, vegetarian friendly \U0001f44d\U0001f3fb&#39;,
   u&#39;We loved our lunch here. Delicious food and a business with a purpose. Loved how the aid to teach the deaf if coupled with a great restaurant. This is a must visit place. Reservations recommended.&#39;,
   u&#39;I heard about this place quite a often. Finally been to mirchi and mime. And the experience was 5/ 5. Even 100 /100.Rajesh took care of our table very well and professionaly. Hats off man. I realy loved the way he serve with smile. And the manager who greeted us from outside, given a table is excellent at his work. The gentlemen who was inside the restaurant probably the manager is very good at his work. The spicy lollipops,, my god delicious but super super hot. But rajesh ne what exactly we wanted. So we got saved. The beautiful part is d god by. Everyone smiles n welcomes. What els you need. Just wowwwwwwwww.....See you soon hero.. Rajesh. Excellent job. &#39;,
   u&#34;Kudos to the owner for this amazing concept! We went there on busy weekend evening for dinner. We didn&#39;t have reservation but they have outdoor section for walk in guests. We went there early so could grab the seats without waiting. Service was bit sluggish given how busy the restaurant was. All the wait staff are verbally challenged but are very courteous. Coming to food, quantity of certain dishes especially starters is small. We had mocktails which also were overpriced. But main course was very very good. Overall fantastic food and good service. But it&#39;s a real shame that they don&#39;t give finger bowls instead they provide wet tissues. A restaurant of this stature in my opinion should not cut corners in such small things. But all in all I would strongly recommend this restaurant to experience the brilliant concept.&#34;,
   u&#34;If you are in Mumbai don&#39;t miss this restaurant.\nA different concept, with the traditional flavours of the Indian cuisine.\nPerfect (deaf) service, good food, good wine.&#34;,

Lastly, it is sacrilege to leave without having the faluda ...Overall the food was excellent, service was very friendly and efficient and the social IQ of the owners to employ those who are usually discarded by the wayside of Indian society and integrate them into highend dining is just exquisite - and you can see the happiness written across the face of the service staff and the kitchen hands. This is not a sad place - and it makes you happy too.Get there *early* and you will NOT regret it.&#34;,
   u&#39;We visited the restaurant on evening for dinner. We booked it in advance. The restaurant is spacious and nicely decorated. The service and the food quality are both good. The price is reasonable.&#39;,
   u&#39;Sorry to say, but other than the thoughtfulness of hiring efficient staff, the food was average for the price. For a teetotaller, it could well be a miss..There are many more restaurants that serve better taste and ambience.Everything, like chicken dahi and angari chicken tasted sweetish..the onion, gobi brought to the table was neither pickled well nor had a dash of lime... serving size was just ok...service was super slow...suuuuppper slllowwww. Worst was sufiyani biryani..oh dat raw taste of mustard..and white raw chicken...worst biryani ever....my son vomitted...Roti were awesome...fresh and hot. Fish starters ok...expensive though. Staff sweet..&#39;,
   u&#39;Everyone is welcomed with a smile here, amazing food, and great services. I would recommend must visit this place, vegetarian friendly \U0001f44d\U0001f3fb&#39;,
   u&#39;We loved our lunch here. Delicious food and a business with a purpose. Loved how the aid to teach the deaf if coupled with a great restaurant. This is a must visit place. Reservations recommended.&#39;,
   u&#39;I heard about this place quite a often. Finally been to mirchi and mime. And the experience was 5/ 5. Even 100 /100.Rajesh took care of our table very well and professionaly. Hats off man. I realy loved the way he serve with smile. And the manager who greeted us from outside, given a table is excellent at his work. The gentlemen who was inside the restaurant probably the manager is very good at his work. The spicy lollipops,, my god delicious but super super hot. But rajesh ne what exactly we wanted. So we got saved. The beautiful part is d god by. Everyone smiles n welcomes. What els you need. Just wowwwwwwwww.....See you soon hero.. Rajesh. Excellent job. &#39;,
   u&#34;Kudos to the owner for this amazing concept! We went there on busy weekend evening for dinner. We didn&#39;t have reservation but they have outdoor section for walk in guests. We went there early so could grab the seats without waiting. Service was bit sluggish given how busy the restaurant was. All the wait staff are verbally challenged but are very courteous. Coming to food, quantity of certain dishes especially starters is small. We had mocktails which also were overpriced. But main course was very very good. Overall fantastic food and good service. But it&#39;s a real shame that they don&#39;t give finger bowls instead they provide wet tissues. A restaurant of this stature in my opinion should not cut corners in such small things. But all in all I would strongly recommend this restaurant to experience the brilliant concept.&#34;,
   u&#34;If you are in Mumbai don&#39;t miss this restaurant.\nA different concept, with the traditional flavours of the Indian cuisine.\nPerfect (deaf) service, good food, good wine.&#34;],

   u&#39;Sea Lounge specializes in light meals so its not for those looking to eat full course meals. It offers a variety of Indian street food and international snacks. We tried their bombay mix toastie, chilly cheese toast and penne pasta along with cold coffee and a berry n apple smoothie. The food was delicious and not to heavy on the pocket as well. The service was efficient and homely. We ended the meal with a gooey chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. We had a lovely meal. The place doesnt have reserved seating so its first come first service. I would recommend taking a window table to get beautiful views of the Gateway of India and the harbour. &#39;,
   u&#39;The full Maharaja high tea was a feast of fabulous hot and cold savouries and then a myriad of sweets. There was no space to put all the plates and trays of food brought hut it was a lovely experience. The Indian foods were best (we can get the ham sandwiches at home so focused on the local foods).&#39;,
   u&#34;One of the great icons of India, the setting and hotel are beautiful, the expectation great, but high tea was a let down. The food was average at best, the service not to be compared with other similar establishments in Mumbai, or across the world. Poor value for money poor at RS3,900 (inc GST) for 2. That said, if you come to Mumbai seeing the sunset here is a must. Just don&#39;t expect too much.&#34;,
   u&#39;Was not a great experience other than the ambience. The snacks they brought us were quite bland and overpriced and they ran out of Kingfisher Ultra (which was also dearer than at our own hotel) and had to get from another bar within the hotel! For a facility within the famous Taj hotel the whole thing lacked a certain spark and felt that we were paying for the privilege.&#39;,
   u&#39;Wow what a place to go for breakfast.\nLots of variety of both European and Indian food\nThe wait staff were only too happy to describe the Indian food and advise of the ingredients.\nWould love to go again however it is fairly expensive&#39;,
   u&#39;We visited Sea Lounge after 30 years. Disappointing to experience poor quality of food served for High tea.The seats were nicely located facing Gateway of India &amp; staff was courteous.The bhels &amp; sandwiches , which are the signature dishes were less than average. you get better quality on streets.Salmon served along bread would have tasted better if roasted.Pav bhaji was good.The most disappointing was tea preparations . They were not brewed properly and ordinary tea leaves were used. The masala tea was disaster.&#39;,
   u&#39;Beautiful setting, white tablecloths, fine china, and professional, attentive service, this dining room is truly elegant for breakfast. Individually prepared eggs, dosas, waffles, or selections from their extensive buffet are all top notch and delicious.&#39;,
   u&#34;I have lived near the Taj in the early 1950&#39;s......many hotels may come and go but to me it was, is , and always will be THE PLACE. We just went to the Sea Lounge for high tea. It was an outstanding experience. We usually have some amazing teas in London., but this is head and shoulders above them all. Apart from scrumptious stuff offered by all teas, the Taj had an extensive supply of very tasty Indian snacks as well. We feasted for nearly three hours. It was an absolute pleasure. The sea Lounge, and the Taj looked as grand as ever.&#34;,

   u&#39;ITC has always been known for its good food, but what makes it more better is its Hospitality. Ever smiling staff, courteous gestures and helmed with food knowledge.Visited during Rajasthani food festival and loved the variety it had on offer apart from the regular fare. &#39;,
   u&#39;Amazing ambience!amazing staff!amazing food!a must go place for especially for sunday brunch. the staff is very courteous and cordial!a special mention of chef aditi and chef rajan!!and definitely a place for desert lovers :)&#39;,

   u&#34; Located in city South Mumbai , Parel (perfect location),the hotel is clean and provides great hospitality. We visited the hotel for Sunday brunch.The staffs were very polite and helpful.The hotel provides amazing facility starting from valet parking to delicious food, good ambiance, nice roof top for photography.Overall experience was awesome.I&#39;ll recommend this hotel to all couples, families, friends and even for corporate functions (You wont regret,just be there:) To sum it all in one line :Nice Food, Nice ambiance, Nice people overall a very nice experience .&#34;,
   u&#39;Located in Parel, this restaurant of ITC Grand Central is a food lovers paradise. I went there for a Sunday Brunch with my friends. The staff there is very cordial. Chef Aditi had made a pizza specially for us which was mouth watering. One surely cannot miss the desserts section and one surely cannot try them all. Do visit the restaurant with your friends and family. A Sunday well spent &#39;,
   u&#39;Went for a Sunday brunch buffet. The spread was vast with multiple cuisines. Thank you to chef Aditi who made a point to give a tour of different dishes, explaining us what went well with what and explaining us about different types of cheese. The cherry on top was the freshly cooked pizza by the chef. The hospitality and the ambience was just perfect for a relaxed, laid back Sunday afternoon. Hope to visit again soon!&#39;,
   u&#34;My family and I have been going to Mumbai for many decades. We always stay at ITC Grand Everytime, and one of the highlights of the trip is the breakfast and meals at Hornby&#39;s Pavalion. I just love the morning breakfast, the special dosas made by Chef Rajan. The special care that the staff takes, with my filter coffee every time I enter the restaurant and the tender coconut water, to special alloo paratha made to order. More importantly Fabian A, is the main manager and he takes extra care of us all. Do want to say a Special thanks to Mr Adhaar in reservations, Mr Gabba (F&amp;B Manager), Rushad at front desk, Mr Sandeep the Concierge; and most importantly the GM Mr Kerman Lalkaka. The great customer service starts from the top and goes throughout the hotel system. &#34;,

   u&#39;I stayed at The Orchid and breakfast was included and each morning breakfast was served at Boulevard. Being from New Zealand on business I found the variety really good. From fruit and yoghurt, to cereals eg Cornflakes, to bacon and sausages, to full on Omelette, to Indian breakfast options. There were Chefs available to cook to your requirements. What more could you want? Service was always great and attentive.&#39;,
   u&#39;Chef Sameer and servers shashi and Karishma provided excellent service to our family. We visited for Diwali lunch .&#39;,
   u&#39;Excellent food and beverage service and a huge variety of consumables with a very kind and polite staff.\nAkshay and shahi and karsihma and chef sameer&#39;,
   u&#39;Morning buffet was soo good. From milkshakes to desserts everything was perfect and tasty. Although they should improve the south indian section. The dosa was too oily.&#39;,

   u&#39;Best punjabi ever had... Bhagat Tara Chand is very much famous in south mumbai, specially for dal tadka,khichya churi, Chass, fulka roti and many more... once in moth I visit here for lunch ya dinner&#39;,
   u&#34;Food is Fantabulous. Yellow Dal, butter chapati, churi papad, chaach - all these are a must have. It&#39;s always crowded and most of the time you have to share table with others.&#34;,
   u&#39;Best food available in this area please visit this once the food here is awesome the quality is the reason i have posted this review&#39;,
   u&#39;Best vegetarian food and good desserts and Buttermilk to diget but too small and full during peak lunch hours.Good veg food and other dishes&#39;,
   u&#39;Amazing taste of every damn dish you will try. You can always have more when you are here. :Loved the food totally.&#39;,
   u&#39;Best Punjabi food ever had,,,taste very yummy and delicious,,chaas bottle must try,,, nice place with family and friends and with large groups also&#39;,
   u&#39;We decided to try Bhagat Tarachad after checking the ratings on Zomato. &#34;4.7&#34; is definitely not an easy thing to ignore. You can walk or take a taxi from Marine lines station. We decided to walk, its almost 1.5kms from station. Ambience is quite humble. We order Spcl Veg Thali. It is the only option in veg thali. They even serve Jain food. The prices that yiu see on the menu card are inclusive of taxes so no additional charges. Thali was good with 1 daal, 1 paneer sabzi, 1seasonal sabzi(in our case it was bhindi aaloo), 1 chole, 3 ghee dripping chapattis, jeera rice, 1 sweet(gulab jamun), and chaas. It is more than sufficient for one person. For Rs. 240 its definitely worth a try. &#39;,
   u&#34;B Bhagat Tarachand is one of the best restaurants in Mumbai. The place is spacious, well lit and staff is extremely well-mannered and alert. But the best part is the food that they offer.Papad Chura is yummy, Aloo jira, shev sabji and butter roti will make you lick your fingers and the chhans is the peak of your food exprence. The desert were also very scrumptious, Randi and well balanced in flavours wasn&#39;t too sweet!&#34;,
   u&#39;Very good vegetarian restaurant in south mumbai...\nliked the food very much but place is not good as it is too much traffic and parking problem&#39;,

   u&#34;B Bhagat Tarachand is one of the best restaurants in Mumbai. The place is spacious, well lit and staff is extremely well-mannered and alert. But the best part is the food that they offer.Papad Chura is yummy, Aloo jira, shev sabji and butter roti will make you lick your fingers and the chhans is the peak of your food exprence. The desert were also very scrumptious, Randi and well balanced in flavours wasn&#39;t too sweet!&#34;,
   u&#39;Very good vegetarian restaurant in south mumbai...\nliked the food very much but place is not good as it is too much traffic and parking problem&#39;],

  [u&#34;There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s so busy. I came her because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. I honestly did not know it was a vegetarian restaurant before I came. Despite not being vegetarian I had a really good meal. The food was extremely tasty and the service was great. Very positive vibes after my first vegetarian meal! Good experience all round! &#34;,
   u&#39;A good old rustic place.\nMouth water food is what you will find here.\nLunch buffet is good thing out here with good variety of Food options.&#39;,
   u&#39;Nicely tucked inside Nariman Point is the Status Restaurant.\nGood food , nice ambiance and a good valve for money restaurant.\nHad a grand time with friends.&#39;,
   u&#39;Visited this place on a Sunday evening at around 7:30 pm and was lucky to get a table in 20 mins...ordered the Gujarati thali as heard a lot about it. The food was good overall. The thepla, Rabri,Gilab jamun and the curries were good the dal was sweet though.the highlight of the meal was the starter that we ordered paneer in pesto sauce and it was super awesome...Status did live up to its name!&#39;,
   u&#39;Awesome veg food , lunch has buffet which is very good and reasonably priced , food is awesome , service is good , crowded on weekends !&#39;,
   u&#39;Status serving amazing food, and I have been here many times, and every time I loved the service and food. There\u2019s also a outside seating where some dishes are served.&#39;,
   u&#39;This place came highly recommended by the staff of Trident and its a 5 min walk so we thought of giving it a try.There was a huge queue before us but because concierge had done a booking for us we were taken in after 5 min. The place was buzzing and the food was simply ultra delicious ...we have sev poori shots which was so good and first time seen it served in a glass ...we had an awesome dinner..and came back the next day for lunch. i would visit this place every time i came to mumbai...what amazing service and could not get enough of the food i wanted to try everything on the menu...its a must for anyone to come to this place..&#39;,
   u&#34;Had a lovely thali lunch here. The place was clean, the staff were friendly and smiling and the food was plentiful and delicious and above all, very reasonably priced.If you are in this area you shouldn&#39;t miss a trip to this restaurant for value for money&#34;,
   u&#39;We loved Status. The Thali was wonderful; tasty, generous and filling!They keep giving you more until you give up!The atmosphere is one of a cafe and that works for what it is. In a city where everything seems expensive, Status was exceptional value.Highly recommended &#39;,
   u&#39;A neat n clean in central place where one can get Indian, South Indian, Gujarati n other variety of food. Famous for Gujarati thali. We had Gujarati thali and khichadi and found to be above our expectations. Place is centrally located, staff courteous n restaurant near n clean.&#39;,

  [u&#39;Having read various reviews and had recommendations from both our hotel concierge and tour guide we were really looking forward to our meal. The restaurant seems to have two wings; we were shown right to the less refined area - but who cares as long as food is good. The staff were attentive and helpful. We found the menus extensive but quite dated in presentation - not what we\u2019d expected from one on Mumbai\u2019s feted eateries.However, the food - perhaps our choices and putting too much emphasis on the personal recommendations - failed to meet expectations. It was fine - my wife chose better then I with her Hyderbadi prawn main course. I chose a butter pepper and garlic prawn dish which was drowned in the taste of butter. The breads were v fresh and not too heavy - excellent.Overall fine, but we left a little underwhelmed.&#39;,
   u&#39;If you are travelling to Mumbai, love seafood and have time for only one meal then it has to be at Trishna.\nRecommendations by staff are good and the food is delicious.&#39;,
   u&#39;Food was great , crab with butter garlic was a 9.5 / 10 for me .....the tandoori king prawns were a little over cooked , but the crab and butter garlic sauce compensated for that....a bit on the higher side ....&#39;,
   u&#39;The king crab with garlic butter was the best we have ever tasted. The fried calamari was spicy and unusual. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The staff is attentive and helpful. This is a real treat.&#39;,
   u&#39;I had a lunch here with my colleagues. They serve very good seafood in different forms! I would recommend you to take seafood items only here in this place. It doesn\u2019t carry any meaning to have chicken in Trishna! Happy eating!&#39;,
   u&#34;Trishna ... the food is excellent and the service we have always got has been super. It&#39;s a great place for sea food lovers and recommendations are to have bombil fry crispy with some beer or white wine and butter garlic crabs. For veg the yellow dal is outstandingYes, it is expensive though to treat yourself from time to time it&#39;s worth it !!!&#34;,
   u&#39;Needed a very good gym workout after this. I visited with my Indian colleague and let him do the ordering. Not always sure what I was eating but the food was delicious. Not overly spicy as I have found elsewhere.&#39;,
   u&#34;I ate at this place last year and really enjoyed it. Took my wife around 8 at night. The staff were very nice and helpful.We ordered lobster and crab.Maybe it was our mistake but the cost is as per weight and we should have asked the price. My wife&#39;s lobster was beautiful. On the other hand my crab was not so. I was served the green pepper sauce and sat waiting expectantly for the crab. I managed to embarrass myself by asking the waiter where my crab was to be told the green sauce WAS the crab.We laughed this off but then we got the bill. It was by far our most expensive meal in India. I have worked here 8 years and been blessed to eat at some wonderful places.The food, a bottle of local Indian wine and a couple of local beers was over \xa3110. Nice but not worth this sort of price tag.My advice would be to check the price of the meal before you tuck in.&#34;,
   u&#39;The restaurant lived up to its image of one the best seafood restaurants in the city. The appam and neer dosa with fish pepper grilled and mutton chettinad was. The restaurant is a bit high on price but the quality and taste justifies it!&#39;,
   u&#39;If you love seafood, you will love Trishna! This quirky little restaurant knows fish! Portions are large, but the server will help you navigate the extensive selections and the quantity. The Butter Garlic Crab, Grilled Pomfret and Creamed Spinach were more than enough for two, and were all out of this world!!!!Service is knowledgable and attentive.This was a marvelous night out!&#39;,

  [u&#39;Had a great time. Had a amazing food and service. First time in prego and it was memorable. Server was really professional and very well knowledgeable. Will be back soon.&#39;,
   u&#39;The ambience is ace and the staff is courteous, my interaction was with Gourav at the bar. He was courteous and offered us with options based on our preferences. The experience was ruined by Keval Soni as he started hurling abuses at the staff In a staff meeting just round the corner. When we shared a glance instead of being apologetic of the behaviour he was rude with a retort. &#39;,
   u&#34;I decided to celebrate my Mothers birthday at Prego and i could not have got a better place to do so. Honestly i was never so keen about Italian food and it was only for my wife&#39;s love for Italian food that we ended up here. But my visit to Prego changed it all. I have never ever known Italian food to be this amazing.I had very bad opinions about minestrone soup but the one i had here was the best. The Aglio Olio peperoncino pasta and Risotto was mouth watering and as a matter of surprise my mother who never loved eating pasta had it to her hearts content.I thank Chef. Vishal Sawant for this sumptous feast of amazing Italian food who was also kind enough to attend our table personally and know our opinions regarding the food. Most of all i am thankful to him for a surprise cake he arranged for my mom. That was really sweet. I would also thank Ms. Mubba for offering her kind and polite service at our table. My mother was really pleased to have such an amazing and memorable birthday.All in all a must visit for all Italian food lovers. You will love it !!! &#34;,
   u&#39;I did my best to find the best Italian restaurant in town to give a memorable experience to my one and only...Along came the MIL and the SIL, who have never had authentic italian culinary experience and have there fair share of Indian curries and are Masters in the Indian Kitchen. The Girls had a once in a life time experience and I hope I was able to give a lasting impression on the one who matters the most to me... The food was Authentic...( check out the bill(pic) for the Items ordered)... Its a fine dinning place at the Westin garden city in Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharastra, India...So expect to get your moneys worth...not crowded... located in quaint area of the Property with a few giggles...Brought back many memories of my one off ten day trip to Italy in 2011...I definitely recommend it ...&#39;,
   u&#39;It was our first experience at Prego and indeed memorable. Ambiance was serene, food was authentic and hospitality was at its best. Special thanks to Chef Antonello for his personal care and recommendations.\nBuch&#39;,
   u&#39;Vinit is Master of his craft. I highly recommend that you give him just a few ideas of what you like and he will delight your every taste. He made me some of the best martinis I have ever had!! I shall now call him Vinit the Martini Master!!! If you are in Mumbai and don\u2019t stop in you are missing out! &#39;,
   u&#34;First evening we went here (5 persons), it went completely wrong. Ordering took forever. Not all dishes arrived at our table at the same moment. For one person it took even almost 45 minutes (!) hour before she got her order. First it seemed they had &#39;lost&#39; her order, some time later it became, clear they then forgot to forward it to the kitchen. Only when someone from us escalated to managament, the order came through. The rest of us already finished their diner long time, of course.Nevertheless, I went back to this restaurant later that week. Once on my own, one time with 4 persons. On both occasions everything went smoothly. The food itself is not okay.&#34;,
   u&#34;We were at Prego for my sons birthday and since he is an Italian food fan we opted for Prego. We didn&#39;t go there with any great expectations but boy, were we wrong!! The food is authentic Italian which is the best ingredients combined with masterful combinations and the best cooking techniques. We loved every dish we ordered but would like to mention the some we loved the most the Carpatio Manzo , Prosciutto and the crab Taglioli. Our family is typically non-veg biased but even the Asparagi soup is to die for. Chef Anto is a master of his craft and a special mention to Mona, who ensured that we had the best time with prompt and interactive service and some good recommendations. This is pure Italian cuisine so don&#39;t expect any fusion and they also have a great veg selection. Its surprisingly Value for money considering the ambiance and cuisine quality and we had the Yes Bank offer too, that was a sweetner. This definitely warrants a second visit, hopefully shortly!! Oh did I mention that Chef Anto sings !!&#34;,
   u&#39;Awesome stuff Naresh is really helpful and makes sure that guests are always happy\nNaresh made sure that our order got to us on time even when there was a lot of crowd\nCheers\nI will see you at prego again&#39;,
   u&#34;I visit prego frequently when meeting friends as it&#39;s in the same building as my office. Super atmosphere, great food, amazing house bread! My favourite is the Chicken Pizza with a beer or Cold Coffee which ever one is in the mood for. A big thumbs up for Monisha for her super service and warm smile. Thank you! All in all one of the best places to chill out in Goregaon East.&#34;,
   u&#39;Had a great time. Had a amazing food and service. First time in prego and it was memorable. Server was really professional and very well knowledgeable. Will be back soon.&#39;,
   u&#39;The ambience is ace and the staff is courteous, my interaction was with Gourav at the bar. He was courteous and offered us with options based on our preferences. The experience was ruined by Keval Soni as he started hurling abuses at the staff In a staff meeting just round the corner. When we shared a glance instead of being apologetic of the behaviour he was rude with a retort. &#39;,
   u&#34;I decided to celebrate my Mothers birthday at Prego and i could not have got a better place to do so. Honestly i was never so keen about Italian food and it was only for my wife&#39;s love for Italian food that we ended up here. But my visit to Prego changed it all. I have never ever known Italian food to be this amazing.I had very bad opinions about minestrone soup but the one i had here was the best. The Aglio Olio peperoncino pasta and Risotto was mouth watering and as a matter of surprise my mother who never loved eating pasta had it to her hearts content.I thank Chef. Vishal Sawant for this sumptous feast of amazing Italian food who was also kind enough to attend our table personally and know our opinions regarding the food. Most of all i am thankful to him for a surprise cake he arranged for my mom. That was really sweet. I would also thank Ms. Mubba for offering her kind and polite service at our table. My mother was really pleased to have such an amazing and memorable birthday.All in all a must visit for all Italian food lovers. You will love it !!! &#34;,
   u&#39;I did my best to find the best Italian restaurant in town to give a memorable experience to my one and only...Along came the MIL and the SIL, who have never had authentic italian culinary experience and have there fair share of Indian curries and are Masters in the Indian Kitchen. The Girls had a once in a life time experience and I hope I was able to give a lasting impression on the one who matters the most to me... The food was Authentic...( check out the bill(pic) for the Items ordered)... Its a fine dinning place at the Westin garden city in Goregaon, Mumbai, Maharastra, India...So expect to get your moneys worth...not crowded... located in quaint area of the Property with a few giggles...Brought back many memories of my one off ten day trip to Italy in 2011...I definitely recommend it ...&#39;,
   u&#39;It was our first experience at Prego and indeed memorable. Ambiance was serene, food was authentic and hospitality was at its best. Special thanks to Chef Antonello for his personal care and recommendations.\nBuch&#39;,

  [u&#39;An small unassuming restaurant with a fantastic endless menu.The Bombay duck was very good, so good I had a second portion. The fish melted in you mouth and the light tempura style batter was just perfect.I followed this with there traditional fish curry with locally caught fish, a thick flavoursome sauce compliment but not over powered the fish. Next I had garlic chilli chicken, amazing flavours and plenty of chicken all washed down with a home made mango lasi.I will defiantly be having lunch here my flight tomorrow.&#39;,
   u&#34;This restaurant is both in the lonely planet and was recommended by our hotel as it was a 1 min walk away. All in all the food was great. The only down side is probably that everyone was being guided to eat the same dishes, something we experienced in more than one resstaurant in India! As long as you&#39;re happy to eat the fish tikka to start and the crab with or without shell for main you will enjoy this experience!! &#34;,
   u&#39;Satiate your desire for sea food here.extremely popular among sea food lovers in the city.do try their tandoori crab and masala pomfret.a big yes from my side&#39;,
   u&#39;We visited this restaurant on recommendation from our hotel and was not disappointed, the curries, rice and breads were all outstanding and the service was superb.&#39;,
   u&#39;This place was excellent for seafood near Taj hotel in mumbai. 10 min drive from Taj. Our whole family enjoyed the food here. Staff was very attentive and provided great service&#39;,
   u&#39;Tried lobster, shrimp and pomfret some in Mangalorean style some in light continental sauces. They serve great South Indian Appams too. The pomfrets were really big . You can order the size you want. Attentive waiters to add. The damage INR 9500 for 4 people. Only one had beer. Too expensive for a way side run of the mill ambience. Nothing exceptional about the interiors.&#39;,
   u&#34;I visited with my partner who was living in Mumbai at the time.We had koliwada fried prawns to start and crab ghee roast for main course. The crab ghee roast was amazing. Very buttery and spicy (I don&#39;t have the greatest spice tolerance and I very much enjoyed this) They bring the crab out to show you before you confirm. Highly recommended checking this place out if you like sea food.Pricing- affordable to expensive bracket depending on what you choose. For two of us the crab was about \xa320. &#34;,
   u&#39;In Mumbai fort area if you look for sea food and other non veg dishes, Mahesh Lunch home is theeee..e best place to enjoy. Top class services and hospitality one gets there. Food served is hygienic and mouth watering.The place is just as you expect,quite clean, and the staff there create the perfect family environment for you.I wish visiting it again and again.&#39;,
   u&#39;While on business trips, I had savoured the culinary fare at their Juhu outlet twice in the past and returned every time asking for more. On a recent weekend sojourn in Mumbai, I wanted to share the gastronomic delight at iconic Mahesh Lunch Home with my dear wife. Thus on a rain-soaked Saturday, we walked into the restaurant on Cawasji Patel Street in Fort for lunch. We were immediately ushered into a table for four at the ground floor section as the crowd was thin at that time of the day. Considering it as an old outlet (since 1977), the refurbished interiors were simple and functional.We ordered a bottle of Kingfisher and glass of ginger-lemon soda to go with a portion of Bombay Duck fry\u2026the famous Bombay Duck or Bombils as known in the local parlance. Lightly battered, rava (semolina) coated and crisply fried bombils were served on a plate\u2026 the fishes with soft flesh and very fine bones were the freshest and tasted simply superb, undoubtedly the best I have had so far! In the main course, we asked for Appam (Kerala style fermented rice pancake), Neer Dosa and a plate of steamed rice with a portion each of Clams Sukha (slightly curried clams) and Crab Curry. The clam preparation was spicy but not pungent at all and we enjoyed every bit of it leaving behind a pile of shells! The crab curry made of a full midsized crab with mildly spicy gravy went very well with rice but the quantity was too much for us to do justice \u2013 we had to pack home much of it for the next day\u2019s lunch. And the entire experience in gluttony at Mahesh cost us only Rs.1625/-\u2026what an aftertaste!!! The wait staff was too polite, friendly and truly helpful assisting us to choose our food, guiding us to use right sauce etc. Such a courteous service endeared Mahesh more to us and enhanced our happiness. The eatery has come a long way in carving out a niche in satiating the denizens of Mumbai with coastal cuisine and firmly etched its claim to fame.&#39;,
   u&#39;This restaurant has amazing food standard and taste . We had sea food dishes , which are a speciality here and really up to the mark . It calls for a revisit .&#39;,

  [u&#39;We had great experience with awesome service from Mr.Asif Shaikh, Shweta and Rishikesh. The food was delicious especially salads, starters and desserts.\nWe would like to come again..\u263a\u263a&#39;,
   u&#39;Their staff was amazing. Diana guided us well and Akshada served us a very good chat and pasta. Good experience at Momo Cafe.&#39;,
   u&#39;Stopped for Buffet Lunch on the way to the airport. They have a Papri Chaat, Golgappas, Sev Puri counters which provide decent taste but I have had better tasting stuff by the roadside. They have extensive selection of salads and cheese which I could not try since we went at 2.30 p.m. and were informed at 2.45 that they would close at 3.00 which was a surprise to us. Someone should have told us in advance when we sat down to eat - or they expect guests to enter a &#34;who eats fastest contest&#34; and finish the buffet in 30 minutes. They also have soups and starters and main course and desserts. Pressed for time I only had time for Pasta in Arrabiata sauce which was excellent and in fact the highlight of the buffet. For main course being a vegetarian I had Paneer Khurchan - avoidable, Bhindi ka Salan - essentially pieces of Bhindi in Salan which didnt taste like Salan (salan is supposed to be spicy but insipid taste here), Aloo (excellent cooked south indian way), Pachranga Dal - not upto the mark - Overall a 2 star rating for main course. Desserts were good and the Rose flavoured Kulfi could have been excellent but for the fact that it was too sweet.However the service was very good and the service staff was constantly monitoring our needs and fetching us whatever we required. Since the place is in the looby , it is quite noisy and if you are looking for a quite place to have food, best avoided&#39;,
   u&#39;Went with copple of friends,, the momo cafe is one of the best restaurant for buffet near to the Mumbai Airport, food was delicious and manager Rupesh was outstanding in his work and handling customers!! Thanx team and continue what u r doing. Best wishes!! &#39;,
   u&#39;One of the most miserably managed restaurant in such a good property. Service was so poor and lethargic that we decided not visit this place for any further meetings.Very sad that such good property is managed by bad team.&#39;,
   u&#39;Momo Cafe at the Courtyard Marriott is a lovely place to have a peaceful, relaxing meal with your friends or family members. The place is very spacious and comfortable.

  [u&#34;Went for a meal last evening with a vegan friend. Burma Burma hit five stars on every count. The food was beyond good. Absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding. We hadn&#39;t reserved a table - so we were made to sit on the bar counter - but that wasn&#39;t a problem at all. The place is vegetarian and serves no liquor, but is jam packed. We tasted the most delicious sauces and had the Burmese falafels - a bit like our massla vada tossed in a most delectable sauce. Also tried the &#39;dry&#39; khao Sui which was outstanding. Loved the place. Will visit again. &#34;,
   u&#39;Very good service and food is also good! Special thanks to the suggestions by the owners for low spice food. Fulfilling.&#39;,
   u&#39;Burma Burma is one of the few completely vegetarian restaurants which offers so much different variety in the dishes. The staff was very courteous and very helpful. They also had 4 different sauces to go with the food. The quality of the food was just awesome . We tried to call for their signature dishes like Samosa soup, chilly tohu ( made out of chickpeas) and of course the khao suey. The soft buns with different fillings was also very good . One more restaurant has been added to my all favorite list. &#39;,
   u&#39;To start with - a warm welcome and we were suggested to have samosa soup &amp; we went with their suggestion - trust me it was just too yummy. Do try out guys if u go here. Than we had a starter- which was notless than main course. We had stuff paratha with gravy. It was enough to get full. Again suggested by the hotel &amp; it turned out to be suppa yummy. Lastly we had their deserts- presentation full marks n taste again full marks. In total - a must go place &amp; a treat for veggie &amp; jaines.&#39;,
   u&#34;Authentic, fresh, vegetarian and yummy food. I&#39;m more of a non-vegetarian when it comes to eating out but for Burma Burma this was my second visit to the restaurant in 3 months considering the fact I stay 60kms away :-) imagine the taste and give it a try &#34;,
   u&#34;A Burmese cuisine vegetarian restaurant was a little difficult to digest when I read about it initially. My mom being a staunch vegetarian, I decided to take her for lunch here while we were visiting town ( South Mumbai)The first surprise was the eloborate menu. All the dishes were sounding so beautiful that it took us some time to actually make a decision. But we were glad for whatever we ordered. It didn&#39;t fail to make us go wow ! My mom being a traditional gujju, loved the food and me being the wild food experimenter, loved it too. The flavours were delicately balanced and the food presentation was good.The dish that really stayed on my mind for long was the avocado and vanilla ice cream. Not only was it refreshingly and deliciously different from usual deserts, but it was presented in quite a theatrical way and was a feast for the eye too.Whether u are a vegetarian or not, I sincerely suggest you try this place out. It&#39;s small, so getting a table is difficult. Suggest you book your table in advance.&#34;,
   u&#39;Good ambience, good variety of food. Loved the Boba tea and Samosa soup. The service was quite slow and for a place which requires booking a week in advance I expected better service. The presentation for the Avocado ice cream was very interesting.&#39;,
   u&#34;This place is tucked into a bylane of the busy Fort business district but accessible easily. Their decor is good, neither minimalistic nor ornate. Our table initially was directly in front of the aircon blast but they promptly shifted is to a more comfortable one.The waiter was helpful in guiding us thru the menu and food came quickly. All the courses were delicious, esp. the grilled sticky mushroom rice. Though they serve only vegetarian items, you don&#39;t miss meats as the vegetarian food is quite tasty. They don&#39;t serve alcohol which can be a deterrent to some guests.We look forward to coming back here.&#34;,
   u&#39;Wow, just wow! Whent here for lunch and it was absolutely great. The setting inside is beautiful and the food was very very good. The mocktails were also great! Recommend the noodles curry and coconut curry. Paid only 1850 for this amazing 2p lunch (2 dishes, 1 rice, 2 drinks, incl tax and service charge).&#39;,
   u&#39;The restaurant stood up to the expectations built up in prior reviews. The steamed buns and starters were great. Main course portions seemed a bit small Staff is very warm and accommodative. We had a good dinner experience&#39;,

Lastly we had their deserts- presentation full marks n taste again full marks. In total - a must go place &amp; a treat for veggie &amp; jaines.&#39;,
   u&#34;Authentic, fresh, vegetarian and yummy food. I&#39;m more of a non-vegetarian when it comes to eating out but for Burma Burma this was my second visit to the restaurant in 3 months considering the fact I stay 60kms away :-) imagine the taste and give it a try &#34;,
   u&#34;A Burmese cuisine vegetarian restaurant was a little difficult to digest when I read about it initially. My mom being a staunch vegetarian, I decided to take her for lunch here while we were visiting town ( South Mumbai)The first surprise was the eloborate menu. All the dishes were sounding so beautiful that it took us some time to actually make a decision. But we were glad for whatever we ordered. It didn&#39;t fail to make us go wow ! My mom being a traditional gujju, loved the food and me being the wild food experimenter, loved it too. The flavours were delicately balanced and the food presentation was good.The dish that really stayed on my mind for long was the avocado and vanilla ice cream. Not only was it refreshingly and deliciously different from usual deserts, but it was presented in quite a theatrical way and was a feast for the eye too.Whether u are a vegetarian or not, I sincerely suggest you try this place out. It&#39;s small, so getting a table is difficult. Suggest you book your table in advance.&#34;,
   u&#39;Good ambience, good variety of food. Loved the Boba tea and Samosa soup. The service was quite slow and for a place which requires booking a week in advance I expected better service. The presentation for the Avocado ice cream was very interesting.&#39;,
   u&#34;This place is tucked into a bylane of the busy Fort business district but accessible easily. Their decor is good, neither minimalistic nor ornate. Our table initially was directly in front of the aircon blast but they promptly shifted is to a more comfortable one.The waiter was helpful in guiding us thru the menu and food came quickly. All the courses were delicious, esp. the grilled sticky mushroom rice. Though they serve only vegetarian items, you don&#39;t miss meats as the vegetarian food is quite tasty. They don&#39;t serve alcohol which can be a deterrent to some guests.We look forward to coming back here.&#34;,
   u&#39;Wow, just wow! Whent here for lunch and it was absolutely great. The setting inside is beautiful and the food was very very good. The mocktails were also great! Recommend the noodles curry and coconut curry. Paid only 1850 for this amazing 2p lunch (2 dishes, 1 rice, 2 drinks, incl tax and service charge).&#39;,
   u&#39;The restaurant stood up to the expectations built up in prior reviews. The steamed buns and starters were great. Main course portions seemed a bit small Staff is very warm and accommodative. We had a good dinner experience&#39;],

  [u&#39;If you are a foodie or not a foodie, looking for authentic south indian food and Maharastrian dishes with the spicness of the authentic taste - you MUST not miss having breakfast at the Vindhyas.ALL items prepared by Chef Balasubramanian win hands on in taste, freshnes, authenticity of preparation. Also, the serving portions are just enough - so that you can partake many items. Want to repaet eating the same item ? No problem eat it any amount , as many times you like.Try Thalipeet with Methkoot ( Grinded Meethi powder - fenugreek seeds powder), Misal pav, Sheera ( a sweet dish), Coin idli, Methi toast, Venkatesh Dosa - the list is long.&#39;,
   u&#34;You walk in to the grand entrance and are treated well...the papadums and pickle and the decor take you back down south..the food is great have mutton Chettinad style was well cooked and stew was lovely.. however it&#39;s surely tad over priced&#34;,
   u&#34;I was staying at the Orchid Hotel in Mumbai and this was one of several restaurants in the hotel. They do breakfast, lunch and dinner however I only ate here for dinner and they open quite late which is useful after a full business day and then attacking the Mumbai traffic! I ate here on three occasions as it was really good and the service was excellent. The a la carte menu was quite varied and they also do a buffet/banquet option which I didn&#39;t try. The dishes that I had were really tasty and I had them with a variety of breads. Cost wise I think this was marginally more expensive than I had eaten at other similar restaurants in the city, but is probably expected as the Orchid hotel is 5 star. After all the various surcharges and taxes the cost soon mounts up. The bottled water which they offer is not free and costs virtually the same as a bottle of beer. Great attentive service.&#34;,
   u&#39;Buffet veg breakfast was enjoyable, the selection was noteworthy.\nENjoyed the Rava dosa, poories and accompaniments. worth a try. madras filter coffee is sought after.&#39;,
   u&#39;Serves breakfast as well. Ideal choice for South Indian food lovers specially Vegetarians. Had breakfast most of the days during stay. Good breakfast platter.&#39;,
   u&#34;I&#39;d say quite tasty dishes as you&#39;d expect in a south indian restaurant .. To top it the place had amazing live music performance (classical). Mesmerizing.&#34;,
   u&#34;I visited this place for breakfast. Excellent food.Excellent staff. The variety of south Indian food is unlimited.. You will be full but their serving won&#39;t stop. They have mini version of all south Indian delicious. Coffee is just refreshing... You can keep on ordering. Amazing!&#34;,
   u&#34;Visited south of vindhya for it&#39;s varied and delecious breakfast. They are offering traditional thali also but decided to taste breakfast. What a selection n presentation. All items prepared amd displaced Puri bhaji masala Puri sweet Puri Kolkata kachori venkatesh dosa and other rare items. Tried almost everything that is served in splatter. Tiny idli. Also.tried Gujarati items ghoogra jalebj and nylon khaman. Summed it with masala chai. Nicely served by waiters in traditional attires.&#34;,
   u&#39;They have very good southern, pure veg breakfast spread. I also had dinner here but did not find the same uniqueness which I experienced in the morning. Good for breakfast&#39;,
   u&#39;Again excellent crew ushers you from the lobby and offers you seats of your choice.\nGood unlimited food and service.\nGood music by Altaf on sitar and his brother on tabla.\nWorth visiting ...&#39;,

  [u&#39;My first ever experience in the restaurant in Bandra. Firstly, the ambience, the decor take you to another world when you enter. The decor, the lake, the table set-up are all rightly done. The buffet is amazingly good with a variety of food, be it Chinese, Japanese or Indian food. Great fushion I must say. The desserts are to die for. You can take whatever you would like, no restrictions!If you are in Bandra, near linking road, Global Fushion is a place to be. A bit over-rated for their Sunday price but the food and service are amazing. But, spend a good 2-3 hours there, relishing all the food you would like to have and have a super light breakfast if you are going for a lunch ;)&#39;,
   u&#39;One of our favourite restaurants in Mumbai. Went for dinner buffet. Their starters spread is just amazing. Dumplings and sushi/ sashimi are top class and the cheese grilled prawns is a family favourite. Starters make you so full that you might hv to skip the main course, because dessert section is something you cannot miss. A very good variety of pastries, ice creams and Indian sweets were on the menu. All in all, a very satiating meal.We got the early bird rates as we finished before 9pm. &#39;,
   u&#39;We were 12 adults and two children at lunch on October 29 afternoon. Variety available was mind-boggling, catering to all tastes. So much good food, that even one was tempted to be a glutton ! Very polite support staff and pleasing ambience. High chairs for the children were very useful. We spent a pleasant over two hours with the family.&#39;,
   u&#39;Visited this place for lunch yesterday and it was an extremely mediocre affair as far as the spread and the service was concerned. The only saving grace were the ice creams. Apparently there is some renovation going on due to which a portion of the restaurant was not accessible.Ideally they should concentrate on the quality rather than the quantity. The service also needs to improve.Overall not recommended.&#39;,
   u&#34;A customer went me there for dunner after a difucult day. I think it was very good choice. The place was very good. The staff was very friendly. The cocktails and the food was amazing. I can&#39;t trll you abou the prices because my customer payed the bill.&#34;,
   u&#39;Its always good to celebrate at global fusion with family and friends as it offers a wide variety of buffet spread along with soft beverages and offers fabulous pan asian starters and a very good spread of mains which also has few indian mains, quality top notch. Sea food served of a good quality and prawns are bigger than the normal size thats a plus point! Desserts are the best as they have B&amp;R counter as well and quite alot of variety in the desserts too Looking forward for my next celebration out there&#39;,
   u&#34;Have been to Global Fusion some 5-6 times (once on a Sunday for brunch and rest of the time in evenings). This happens to be the safest place for me to take colleagues and family when there is a huge disparity in cuisine tastes amongst people; because Global Fusion has a great spread and literally serves almost all popular cuisines in its buffet. It has light snacks/starters for the health conscious so even better. Usually people end up stuffing themselves with starters only and have minimal main course. Great desserts counter too especially the Basking Robins counter for all kinds of ice cream flavors. The location is pretty central however parking is a little tight (a very narrow lane in the building) despite valets&#39; availability&#34;,
   u&#39;Right place to be when bidding adieu to an old employee. Bandra location is always buzzing.Oriental food lover will love this place to the fullest extent.The office group went on a buffet I believe they have ala carte menue too. Nice ambience, awesome crew and variety of dishes and drinks for all sort of people under one roof. Highly recommended to all, prior reservation is an absolute must. &#39;,
   u&#34;On top of a mall , high roof &amp; fish pond adds to the good ambience , it is a big place but still gets crowded on weekends. They have discount if you can finish the food before 9pm . Its a buffet only restaurant. the spread is awesome.. lots of Japanese / thai type of salads , sushi&#39;s , hot starters are great , you select &amp; its served at the table piping hot.have tempura&#39;s , good choice of seafood , if you are looking for desi indian stuff , not much. But if you up for Asian food its just great.Normally try to visit this restaurant when am in Mumbai , been here 4~5 times since I found this 2 years ago, but each time by the time I finish with salads , soup , Starters , am so full that have to skip the main curries . Dessert is ok , good array of Baskin robins icecreams.btw the food is Halal&#34;,
   u&#39;Make no mistake: this is a clean and delicious space. Think about a buffet-type format. They make good food of a pretty wide variety, sushi-to-indian-to-pasta. I found it lacked a soul or personal touch, the food was decent but not spectaculary. Many dishes grade B but no dish grade A. &#39;,

  [u&#39;We had visited on a weekday for dinner. Ordered dosa, idli, vada and coffee. All the items were really yum and we had seconds too.. One of the few authentic South Indian veg restaurants in Mumbai, it tends to get a bit crowded. You might have to wait for few mins and the seating is not too comfortable either. This place is all about good food and not a hangout sort of place. Just eat and go. &#39;,
   u&#39;Near matunga king circle.. superb and mouth watering idli dosa and mendu wada.. very much famous and lots of people visit here for breakfast&#39;,
   u&#39;Heard a lot about the place so went on a Sunday morning.... waited for over 45 minsThen got a table on the first floorOrdered mouthwatering idlis, sumptuous dosa,Andhra speciality pesarattu, vada and pineapple ksheera thoroughly enjoyed the food it\u2019s a must visit place for a tasty South Indian breakfast that too at a cheap price&#39;,
   u&#39;A place in the city which serves the best South Indian food at pocket friendly prices. There is a lot of queue especially on weekends, so plan your visit accordingly.&#39;,
   u&#39;It is a nice place to have south indian cuisine. It has various types of dosas idlis etc. Try there gunpowder with is awesome.&#39;,
   u&#39;Awesome place with best food options..\nMust try neer dosa and filter kappi ,my favourite and try pineapple sheera n upma.. also idili n dosa.. authenticate taste with rich food quality \U0001f44d\nMust try neer dosa \U0001f60b&#39;,
   u&#34;Very good dosa. Worth a try . It&#39;s like south India has come to Mumbai , I have been there solo as I live in Mumbai, I can come anytime, for this food in Mumbai.&#34;,
   u&#39;Anyone wanting to have authentic filter coffee can head to this place. Its generally packed in the evening. So keep 15 minutes aside for waiting.&#39;,
   u&#39;This much awarded South Indian Restaurant is a jewel in Matunga. All the awards &amp; accolades are very well deserved.Be prepared to share tables in this very fuss free setup. Must try their Set Dosa with White Butter, Upma, Idli Podi &amp; Rasam Vada. Their Rasam is the best across all other South Indian Restaurants in the vicinity.Their service is fast &amp; fuss free. &#39;,
   u&#39;best are the dosas, idlis and mendu vada, worth the trip and cheap, located centrally from all locations in Mumbai&#39;,

  [u&#34;I read the rave reviews and decided I needed to go here for their brunch/lunch buffet. I was shocked to experience that what was being said was not true at all. If they call it a brunch, all the breakfast items were missing! No eggs, no cereal, no pancakes, and no waffles. Whoever said there is a huge spread really hasn&#39;t been to a quality brunch. Cold cuts were dumped in a corner. Salads were limp, looked dead and best not eaten. The Asian food other than dumplings was a massive disappointment. Even your favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant without a star rating will serve better food. The chat station was horrible. The person making the chat should be arrested just for not being able to make chats. The grill section had tasteless grills. They used frozen prawns. The continental food was horribly tasteless. Polenta and mashed potatoes with too much salt were inedible. A simple dish like potatoes in the jacket with cheese was bland and tasted like boiled potatoes. The Indian food was average or even less. The dal was watery and tasteless. The starters were again over salted. The desserts were a massive massive disappointment. They were not sweat and badly made. The tiramisu was a big let down. The service here was slow and average. The drinks were replaced very very slowly and we had to make repeated repeated requests. This buffet is just a waste of money and not worth even one tenth of the price they charge. The chef really needs to learn to cook and to taste it before he serves the guests. Better planning and better staff are needed here. Good quality and fresh seafood is not hard to procure in Mumbai but they serve frozen stuff!&#34;,
   u&#39;Pondichery Cafe A Cafe at Sofitel BKC!! Had been to this place with my friend taste was good, ambience was awesome enjoyed a lot, their slow service which took almost half n hour for providing us a frappe!! Apart From This, The Ambience, Decor, Taste and Presentation was Upto the mark, With A Classy Look will take you to top of the world, i.e next to Heaven, but yess Lil bit quick Service is expected by this cafe :)&#39;,
   u&#39;Whether it is Breakfast or Lunch or Dinner, the spread at Pondicherry gets bigger and Better, and it becomes difficult to choose sometimes or many a time. The service is impeccable and well dressed staff are at waiting to serve without any demur. Elton, Kanchan and others are on their feet and Service can not be better. And the Food is mouthwatering and delicious whether Veg or non-veg. And festival at different times of the year whether National or international can give you a surprise. The Quality is excellent whether it is food and/or service, and the wellness drinks offered can lead to a healthy time.&#39;,
   u&#39;The ambience of sofitel is sophistication and brilliance personified. Spacious and manned by welcoming hospitable staff, that was my first impression of this elegant cafe.Thai Food Festival added colourful elan to the overall appeal of this place.Being true to its theme, the decor gave you all the Thai feels you need. Chiang Mai Umbrellas, exotic fruits and friendly smiles of well learned chefs, cooking yummiest of Thai delicacies - this is what a single glimpse of this festival offered. Though menu changes everyday but this are some of our favorites from the festival.Som tum :Green papaya salad freshly made by chef sorataj himself is just perfect! &#34;You might exhale fire like a dragon&#34;Thai curry :Thai veg palate would be incomplete without their authentic curry. It will surely take your taste buds on a foodgasmic journey.Tom kha hed :Coconut and mushroom soup is surely a result of chef\&#39;s art! It is very much satisfying and refreshing. Vegans this is a big treat for you all.The Desserts! Dont even get me started!Your taste buds will take a whole smooth trip to the seventh heavens! With ample variety of sweet treats for vegetarians and eggetarians; and Indian and western savouries, you are sure to gasp for more. Some solid sweet-gasms here!I\&#39;d like to thank Ranjeet for his excellent service!&#39;,
   u&#39;Had lunch at Pondicherry Cafe on my daughters birthday.. The staff made the experience an amazing one with all the surprises they had in store for my daughter.&#39;,
   u&#39;The food and service in Pondicherry Cafe are top notch. Do drop in and enjoy the taste of India and the world.&#39;,
   u&#39;The spread is so mammoth that whenever I have been there for the buffet had skipped my breakfast that day and also had a light meal the previous night. Has to be a planned meal :-) for me. They have a various cuisines spread. I end up having fish from all of them. Its high value but for me once a year its worth it.&#39;,
   u&#39;Wonderful spread of food, and most importantly, superb service, and very kind Executive Chef who comes out and extend his help.\nThank you Elton, and Chef (sorry did not catch your name) for your kind help&#39;,
   u&#39;A great repast Many dishes Many varieties Unfortunately due to a power outage as informed by Chef Shrikant the food was a trifle cold But no worries Rohan was quick to the rescue and promptly got us a plate full of piping hot foodThe rotis served were crispy and hot The chicken curry good The lahsooni chicken tikka was delectable The paneer tikka looked great but had no taste The south eastern counter was by far the best Kudos to Pradeep Rai the chef His stir fry veggies plus chicken was too goodLiked the prawn dimsum tooJason of the dessert counter deserves applause as well Made a great Berry Framboise ! A must haveLoved the Estrezy And the chocolate berry as well Ice creams are from London Dairy Overall a 3.5 but for the dessert special it becomes a four&#39;,
   u&#39;We were spending the weekend at Sofitel, .. we had a couple of meals at Pondicherry cafe.. This time we were taken care of by Prashant and for the first time we really enjoyed being taken care off, not only politely but with a smile and personal attention.. The food is good, not great.. but the overall experience was great unlike our previous visits, in fact for our overall stay, we were served much better..So if you are in the vicinity, feel like a 5 star with good food, and good service, do drop in.. P.S. The portions though are only for one.. &#39;,

Spacious and manned by welcoming hospitable staff, that was my first impression of this elegant cafe.Thai Food Festival added colourful elan to the overall appeal of this place.Being true to its theme, the decor gave you all the Thai feels you need. Chiang Mai Umbrellas, exotic fruits and friendly smiles of well learned chefs, cooking yummiest of Thai delicacies - this is what a single glimpse of this festival offered. Though menu changes everyday but this are some of our favorites from the festival.Som tum :Green papaya salad freshly made by chef sorataj himself is just perfect! &#34;You might exhale fire like a dragon&#34;Thai curry :Thai veg palate would be incomplete without their authentic curry. It will surely take your taste buds on a foodgasmic journey.Tom kha hed :Coconut and mushroom soup is surely a result of chef\&#39;s art! It is very much satisfying and refreshing. Vegans this is a big treat for you all.The Desserts! Dont even get me started!Your taste buds will take a whole smooth trip to the seventh heavens! With ample variety of sweet treats for vegetarians and eggetarians; and Indian and western savouries, you are sure to gasp for more. Some solid sweet-gasms here!I\&#39;d like to thank Ranjeet for his excellent service!&#39;,
   u&#39;Had lunch at Pondicherry Cafe on my daughters birthday.. The staff made the experience an amazing one with all the surprises they had in store for my daughter.&#39;,
   u&#39;The food and service in Pondicherry Cafe are top notch. Do drop in and enjoy the taste of India and the world.&#39;,
   u&#39;The spread is so mammoth that whenever I have been there for the buffet had skipped my breakfast that day and also had a light meal the previous night. Has to be a planned meal :-) for me. They have a various cuisines spread. I end up having fish from all of them. Its high value but for me once a year its worth it.&#39;,
   u&#39;Wonderful spread of food, and most importantly, superb service, and very kind Executive Chef who comes out and extend his help.\nThank you Elton, and Chef (sorry did not catch your name) for your kind help&#39;,
   u&#39;A great repast Many dishes Many varieties Unfortunately due to a power outage as informed by Chef Shrikant the food was a trifle cold But no worries Rohan was quick to the rescue and promptly got us a plate full of piping hot foodThe rotis served were crispy and hot The chicken curry good The lahsooni chicken tikka was delectable The paneer tikka looked great but had no taste The south eastern counter was by far the best Kudos to Pradeep Rai the chef His stir fry veggies plus chicken was too goodLiked the prawn dimsum tooJason of the dessert counter deserves applause as well Made a great Berry Framboise ! A must haveLoved the Estrezy And the chocolate berry as well Ice creams are from London Dairy Overall a 3.5 but for the dessert special it becomes a four&#39;,
   u&#39;We were spending the weekend at Sofitel, .. we had a couple of meals at Pondicherry cafe.. This time we were taken care of by Prashant and for the first time we really enjoyed being taken care off, not only politely but with a smile and personal attention.. The food is good, not great.. but the overall experience was great unlike our previous visits, in fact for our overall stay, we were served much better..So if you are in the vicinity, feel like a 5 star with good food, and good service, do drop in.. P.S. The portions though are only for one.. &#39;],

  [u&#39;Wonderful food , presented in innovative ways. Tastes , textures and look of each dish is great. We had the 16 dish Tasting Menu which I would recommend for a real understanding of what the chef is aiming for . The service was excellent.&#39;,
   u&#39;We tried the set menu , offered at masala library on our special lunch. The menu was well curated and dishes were a treat to the eyes! Every single dish presented in a unique manner. The taste, texture and color of the delicacies being served was all very unique and contrasted well with the unique serving plates.We were the first lucky ones to taste the &#34;galouti kebab&#34; and I must say it was simply irresistable.Must visit place for beautiful food.&#39;,
   u&#39;after months of speculation of whether to have expensive food or not I finally went to ML BKC with my cousin last night before going I was advised by my cousin to do a pre booking, called up at reception staff said we accept booking only at 7:30 or for 10:00 pm slot , we tried our luck and went there and was told to wait for 10 mins and our table was ready , on entering all i could notice was white sheets covering all tables, we were offered last row, my cousin asked for lamb dish from the menu to which staff replied is not available so we order saag and with seekh kabab and dal makhani and naan n roti , i could not distinguish between the food i had here and any other restaurant offering food in a competitive prices it was saag gravy with kabab dropped in it n dal makhani was super and i was expecting that expensive naan will melt in mouth but i was wrong and gave feedback on the form as it was, expecting staff will ask for more detailed feedback .... i like the line......does anyone care for one more roti....&#39;,
   u&#39;This is one of those places where you take someone on a date, someone whom you want to impress badly! The food is delectable and so is the presentation. But be prepared to shell out a heavy load out of your pocket.&#39;,
   u&#39;Visited Masala Library last week awesome food fantastic ambience variety of dishes with equally lip smacking taste staff is very helpful and decent. Additional 5 stars for chef and his innovative dishes. Definitely a place to go with family and friends. If visiting ask for chefs speciality &#39;,
   u&#39;This is the 2nd time I was here and not so much for the food but for the presentation with some friends. Must give them credit for working hard on quality of staff, training them and making them present well.What we had was :Almond curd with bonda...(basically dahi wada)PrawnsFish Mutton rogan JoshChicken masala Tomoto soup.Dahi vada and mutton rogan were good. The key was quality of meat and perfectly cooked. ..chicken was too raw though.Must credit the waiters with good knowledge and ability to explain the stuff that is being presented. Master chef kinda look and feel in every plate. Too expensive though. It cost us about 1500 per head without drinks.Overall one time place.&#39;,
   u&#39;Visited the place today. The food is lovely. They offered a few complimentary dishes to arouse n mellow ur pallet during a course change. Overall a fantastic experience. A bit expensive place though... but worth it.&#39;,
   u&#39;What they do with food simply amazed me!! Lovely people around...been a fan! Presentation of the food will create a vow in your eyes and taste of the food will simply add to this vow...&#39;,
   u&#34;My wife has been struggling to get reservation and we always needed to find alternate place because of non availability and today finally got the chance and right now sitting here having food.. not sure what it&#39;s all about.Beyond creating a stylish way to serve, there is nothing anything special about it. The tasting menu includes all the boring and sad wines one could imagine ... The food is also very average ! Just for one time visit..&#34;,
   u&#39;I called up the hotel for table reservation. The person from the hotel attending indicated that there are only two slots for booking a table. One is at 7:30 pm and other at 10:00 pmI indicated that we have a group of 10 people coming from different directions in Mumbai and we may be able to stick to the timing as it depends on the traffic. He said sorry.... its our company policy ...you need to be at the hotel at sharp 8:00 pm other wise he will withdraw the reservation... it is like punching at the office/factory on time otherwise the HR will cut your salary.

 [u&#39;My business trip has been one of firsts, two of which are this was my first ever visit to India, and my first ever visit to an Indian restaurant. I had the good fortune to visit restaurant Nawab Saheb, located in the Renaissance Mumbai Convention Centre Hotel.Everyone was very friendly and helpful explaining the menu. The server who took my order asked if I ever had Indian spices before, and he said he would advise the chef to modify the spice level for me. Later on, I had a chance to meet the chef, Kasim Khan, who came to my table to ask about how his preparation of the food was for me. I told him it was a delicious experience, and thanked him for personally talking with me. Later on, Chef Khan returned with a small gift from the restaurant to me, a package of the spices used in preparation of the food for me to add to my vegetables at home. He gave me his contact information in case I had questions.Another person who was friendly and informative was Jayshree, head of the serving staff. I ordered the Vegetarian special, which was an offering of a number of appetizers and entrees, with breads and a dessert bar. I enjoyed my first Indian cuisine experience, every item was so delicious, tasty and interesting. I will return, and recommend this restaurant. They made me feel like family.If you visit the restaurant on the weekend, live music, featuring traditional Indian music, will add to your dining experience, as it did for me.&#39;,
  u&#34;The food and ambience here is really nice and its a great way to experience real Indian food and at the same time make sure that you won&#39;t suffer from any stomach issues. We had the large tasting menu and all dishes were of very high quality. 1 advice: stay away from the paan (bethel leave sweet)&#34;,
  u&#39;We arrived at this restaurant and were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. The service was prompt and the menu explained in detail by Azad who continued to serve us throughout the meal. The food was delicious and was served in copper plates that are traditional to the Royal classes of India. On two occasions through our very tasty meal Purvesh (the chef) came over to ask if his cooking was to our liking! Fully recommend this beautiful restaurant and special thanks to Azad and Purvesh who really went the extra mile to ensure our visit was something to remember. Absolutely brilliant. &#39;,
  u&#39;Had dinner at Nawab saheb - this is an Indian restaurant located within the Renaissance Hotel at Powai. The restaurant is well furnished with tall ceilings and nice decor. They have live Indian music in the evenings with a good singer - we started our dinner at around 7 15 PM and had the restaurant and the singing all to our selves. By 8:30 the restaurant started filling up - seems to be quite popular - the food was exceptional - we went for the set meal, one Vegetarian and the other non vegetarian - this comes with a set of unlimited starters. the non vegetarian had 2 types of chicken, one fish and two lamb starters - all of them were superb. The main course was also good but we were already full with the starters. The desert options were also huge - overall a great experience with great food and soothing music. &#39;,
  u&#39;The set menu is a fantastic way to experience a number of different dishes. Presented beautifully, and in a lovely environment, it was a great introduction for me to traditional North Indian dishes. I\u2019m used to South Indian food, and was pleased to get some tips on how a couple of the fish dishes were prepared. Looking forward to another night here, for sure!&#39;,
  u&#39;I have visited most of the fine dine restaurants. the consistency is appreciated. Chef Younus is one of the finest chefs in the country. Kudos&#39;,
  u&#34;Whenever I have a strong craving for good north indian or punjabi food, Nawab Sahab is the place I visit. It&#39;s is really disappointing to be in mumbai if you love good, spicy and rich north indian food because most of the places here are serving food with gujrati or south indian food flavours and forget authenticity, but this is one place where you feel like you are enjoying your food in Delhi restaurant. Dal Lakhani &amp; Deserts are to die for.&#34;,
  u&#39;The whole experience was royal, good ambience and enjoyed lovely live Ghazals on Saturday with Dinner booked thru Eatigo. Opted for set meals which provide a range of options from Non veg, Sea food as well as Mix and Match. The appetizers were well succulent and delicious in taste and served with a lot of interest and patience which added a notch to the eating experience. The mains were equally well prepared and went well with the garlic nans and laccha parathas. The wide desert spread had something for everyone from fresh fruits, indian sweets like gulab jamuns, ras malai and also ice cream. The staff were immaculate in their service and special thanks to &#34;Jayshree&#34; and team to help make this a memorable dining experience. Strongly recommended if you are a food lover and would like to relish a lavish indian spread + great service.&#39;,
  u&#39;Lovely ambience. Lovely hospitality. Jayshree. Very careing. Very delicious and light food They entire team including the chef is very careing hospitable . I love this place and would recommend people to come here to have a lovely candle light dinner. &#39;,
  u&#39;This one is worth the visit since the food is very very tasty and it is also service oriented one.rates are manageable&#39;,

  [u&#39;I stayed 11 nights on business at this property! From the minute I checked in until the day I checked out, I received superb service from the front desk!My room was always cleaned to a very high standard!Food was great in this hotel.I had a great experience at this hotel. It was my first time but I would highly recommend it and look forward in visiting in the future.&#39;,
   u&#39;Breakfast and Sunday Brunch was amazing at Citrus. Champagne buffet is the way to go. Food is excellent....amuse bouche is fabulous in this restaurant. So many exciting things to see and taste. Service is excellent ! Rohit, great service! &#39;,
   u&#39;I enjoyed my 2nd time stay at The Leela as expected; hotel with high standard and very friendly staff starting from the picking up service from the airport till the last moment of my stay. highly recommended.&#39;,
   u&#34;This isn&#39;t my first visit to The Leela, and it won&#39;t be my last. The service is exceptional; from the time I&#39;m picked up at the airport, to the time I depart. Everyone working there aims to please and is truly genuine. Quick check in on the 8th floor. Lovely breakfast in the morning; the manager at Jamavar more than happy to make some special meals for my little one. Can&#39;t think of a single thing to complain about. If the Leela keeps this up, I won&#39;t even bother looking online for a different place to try.&#34;,
   u&#39;Since we had a 3am flight we decided to stay close to the airport. This is a perfect choice. After hours of traffic, honking horns and to much Indian food this was a peaceful end to a good trip. The pool is large and plenty of service and shade. We had lunch by the pool, a welcome salad. Then went to the spa for a great massage.We met in the lobby bar had a drink then enjoyed an Italian dinner on the top floor. The rooms were well appointed, large shower and bath tub. We slept for a few hours and then the hotel offered a transfer to the airport just 5 minutes away. &#39;,
   u&#39;Excellent service from the time you arrive at airport all the way you leave back. Service is always very consistent form Chauffeurs, Door man, Bell desk , Receptions staff, Lobby staff and staff at the eighth floor reception/Lounge. Food is very good at restaurant with many varieties and staff are very attentive and friendly as well. Room serve again very good.Hotel, rooms and washrooms are luxurious and Leela always have great properties. Probably I have stayed with Leela Mumbai for more than 60 times in all these years and always felt as my second home.Only thing I would expect is in some rooms power points near the bed/night lamp.&#39;,
   u&#39;It\u2019s a great hotel to be in. And everything is just more than perfect. Can\u2019t expect more than this. It\u2019s value for money. Service and all the help I got is just out of my imagination. I can\u2019t see my self in any other hotel than this one. &#39;,
   u&#39;Service quality is excellent, as usual. Warm people, from the person who meets you and greets you at the airport to the person who drops you back at the airport. Tasty food! Overall, a pleasant experience.&#39;,
   u&#34;From the moment your representative greets you as you come out of the arrival halluntil the time that your driver takes one back to the airport, you don&#39;t have to think, all your requirements are anticipated by your wonderful staffthe concierge staff are so welcoming and your 8th floor reception make checking in so fast and easy. the rooms and the hotel facilities are excellent, but for me it is your staff especially, who make my stays such a pleasurable experience. I always look forward to staying at the Leela&#34;,
   u&#39;I just love this place. Every time I travel to Mumbai, I make it a point to stay at The Leela. This is one of the best luxury hotels. Very courteous staff, very accommodating ... as it is said that Indian are best at hospitality, The Leela is THE best.&#39;],

  [u&#39;-DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL, -HAD A LOT OF MONEY STOLLEN FROM SAFE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO DAMAGE - can clearly see someone has opened the safe-CCTV shows a member of management entering during the hours of the room being empty and leaving 3 minutes later - HOTEL DOES NOTHING &amp; takes no responsibility.Disgusting!!! Avoid!!!!!!!!!&#39;,
   u&#39;We went out for 30 minutes and someone stole \xa32000 from our safe.. when looking back at the CCTV we saw the manager walk into our room and walk out 5 minutes later. when we spoke to the reception they accused us of lying and would not co-operate. We had to force them to show the CCTV and you can clearly see the manager walking in and out 5 minutes later and no one else walking in or out of the room.&#39;,
   u&#34;Stayed here for 3 night&#39;s in Oct in the beach facing luxury room and this is our honest feedback for the same..Staff-lots of old faces and old guns in the armour. This hotel is a old hotel and probably believes that old is gold. Staff are friendly and helpful esp at the restaurant and the live food counters. Seen a lot of happy and smiling faces throughout our stay right from the bell desk to the housekeeper boys. 3.5/5.Rooms- neat and clean. The room was well maintained but the mattress and pillows need to be upgraded to better ones. Could have been better. The laundry service was quick and the room boys did a good job. Full marks to housekeeper boys and room cleaning. The location is a crowd puller and the view from the room is breathtaking. 4/5.Food- Delicious would be an understatement. The food looks much better than it actually tastes to tell you the truth. You really don&#39;t feel like eating it the way it&#39;s garnished.Superb! The chefs make your day in the mornings at the egg counter and dosas. Very friendly and outgoing unlike other hotels in the vicinity. Full marks to food presentation and taste. Breakfast spread the best so far we have tried in all 5 stars. Foodies paradise I must admit. 4.5/5.Cons-1) lot of noise of some civil work happening in the day time is a big put off and deprives you of good day naps. 2) Wi-Fi should be made cheap if not free. We are in the 21 century guys. 3) there should be more Jain and gluten free options in the dinner buffet. 4) no shower caps in the pool pls and no forcing business pls.not acceptable for a 5 star hotel.That&#39;s it for now till we visit you next. Keep up the efforts and looking forward to stay here again in Dec.Till then adeus.&#34;,
   u&#39;I m staying in room no 421 and my room next room is suit room, never ever expect from your hotel that much noise comes in my room. With me my 1yr old baby girl and she disturb whole night &amp; when we decide to give her good sleep In noon so there room clean noise start. Suit room bathroom connect with 421room so bathroom water noise whole night, at last around 3am I need to complain on reception &amp; same this thing start in noon... not happy this time with your service , even I ask for extra water bottle for my baby so your staff said it\u2019s a chargeable not complimentary, so it mean in whole day &amp; night u need to stay in 4bottle only. Visit 421 &amp; heard how noise comes from suit room , after u get to know suggest this room to anyone or not ... &#39;,
   u&#39;The stay was pleasant for the 3 nights i spent there. Check in was smooth...since there was a lack of King size bed in my category they upgraded me (with a little bit of haggling though)..The room was spacious and had all the basic amenities. Stay was comfortable. Had an access to the beach,,which was good...Pool looked good however did not use it..Breakfast was good, however felt the Dosas could have been better. Room service menu can offer a little more of variety considering what the Hotel had to offer in the other restaurant. Check out was smooth.&#39;,
   u&#34;WARNING- if you are paying a security amount to this hotel be careful!!! We stayed from 26-28th September and paid 4000 INR as security. They have not returned it till now inspite of continuous follow up. They don&#39;t call back either. The hotel claims to be a 5 star only basis of being a sea side property. Rest nothing is 5 star about it. Rooms have old furniture, soggy smell &amp; old bath fittings.Breakfast layout is decent but good quality that of a 3 star hotel. The staff asked me to pay extra for the fruit &#39;kiwi&#39; when I was picking fruits from fruit basket laid out at the buffet. Wifi is chargeable only for online bookings in today&#39;s date where most bookings are online. If you directly book with the hotel it isn&#39;t! Ground staff, waiting staff is nice but managerial and above is pathetic. Not at all helpful and cooperative. To everything they had one answer- it&#39;s a policy.We travel a lot for business and leisure. This is one of the worst and the value one gets for the price is really low. Not returning there for sure. There are much better hotels. &#34;,
   u&#39;I have stayed here a few times. The services and facilities were average, not bad. The location is good, which has been the prime the reason of my choice. However recently I had booked this property through a portal with a &#34;No Cancellation Fee&#34; which was to end 48 hours before arrival. Due to very inclement weather in Mumbai my meetings got cancelled and I informed the property that I will not be checking in, which I did about 36 hours before scheduled arrival. I did not want a refund. I proposed a new date where the booking could be shifted agreeing to pay any extra costs. The answer was clear \&#39;no&#34;. So I was charged 2 full days (about Rs 18000) without stepping in to the property. Legally they had a right to do what they did. I thought I should put this up for those who want to go beyond just the amenities that a hotel offers&#39;,
   u&#39;The sea princess most fraud hotel seen in my life as they referred me to take a membership and once i got convinced as paid for my membership and there were some amenities to be given as per the mail they sent me and later they totally changed their statement..I cancelled my membership and asked for the refund so they were suppose to refund back month but they failed on their commitments and now stopped reverting back and answering calls..never seen a pathetic and unprofessional fraud hotel like this..&#39;,
   u&#39;Oceanic DelightsIt is one thing to look like a celebrity and just another when someone makes you feel like one! I experienced this exacting feeling at the Sea Princess Hotel, in Mumbai. I cannot thank Jerson Monterey Jack and his team enough to enliven my spirits and transport me straight to cloud nine! I started off with a \u2018mixed berry juice\u2019, dominated by fresh strawberries. This totally revved my spirits and I couldn\u2019t wait to down the sumptuous spread on the buffet. The buffet imparted a global air with dishes from around the world dotting the rather enticing spread. The presentation of the salads and dessert was simply awe-inspiring. I was amazed at the creativity that was invested in each of the dishes. The flavours were authentic, and the food was fresh; and cooked to finger-licking perfection. I started off the chef\u2019s very special, \u2018Organic Garden Green salad\u2019, complete with orange scented quinoa quenelles, caramelized walnuts, and herb crusted crisps. I also savoured the activated charcoal scented \u2018Pav Bhaji Di Gaddi\u2019 (A very rural but most cherished mixed vegetable preparation cooked in a special assortment of spices, served with bread, finely chopped onions, pomegranate seeds, and a crispy savoury snack called \u2018Sev\u2019. I couldn\u2019t but marvel at the \u2018Chemistry Lab\u2019, a shredded chicken dish topped off with cream, and roasted on a skewer on an open fire kiln (tandoor). The biryani too was differently presented. The neatly piled rice was topped off with a patty (meat / vegetarian) and flat bread, and was completed with a \u2018Papad\u2019 (A crispy roasted lentil savoury, which is often preferred fried as well). The array of other dishes included the wood tossed pizzas, which a thin and crispy base, a melange of vegetables that included the famed corn and spinach mix completed in Indian spices, the \u2018Sahi vegetable mix\u2019 (completed in a creamy gravy), and a lot more. The list continues onward to a black lentil prep, a \u2018Pulav\u2019 (a vegetable and meat infused rice preparation complete with the fragrant aroma of saffron), Haka Noodles (A Chinese favourite), Ravioli (Tossed in red sauce and olives), Mixed vegetable done in hot bean sauce and shezwan, stir fried vegetables and a lot more. I also cherished the desserts that were skilfully arted to perfection. I cannot stop ranting about the delicious \u2018Walnut Halva\u2019 (finely grinded walnuts, tossed in clarified butter, and cooked with sugar, cardamom, and saffron), the caramel custard, enticing array of cheesecakes, fruit panacottas, some fusion desserts, and many more. What starred the show was the \u2018Chocolate Bomb\u2019 (another of the chef\u2019s special) complete with a creamy cheesecake, and a whiskey caramel hot sauce, parked inside a chocolate dome. The dish delectably opens up as molten chocolate is poured onto the chocolate dome, revealing the internal goodies. The restaurant overlooks the Mumbai horizon and the beachy reserves that border the city. I caught a whiff of the upcoming winter into my hair. The Sea Princess Hotel serves as a the perfect brunch destination, frequented by the city\u2019s celebrity circuit. Truly Chef Jerson Monterey Jack can make one feel like a star at any hour!&#39;,
   u&#39;SeaPrincess is an awesome choice suggested by my friend and I had lovely 2-3 business days spent at this hotel. Their rooms were clean ,staff was courteous and very hospitable environment. I would love to choose this hotel again if coming to mumbai ..Also it is a sea facing restaurant with ever lovely sea breeze on 24x7..lovely time spent ..!&#39;],

   u&#39;The hotel is best &amp; staff is very cooperative. But the food is not very good , few options for vegetarian people. The overall food is pretty expensive could not find many food options. The breakfast menu is repeated for both the days. Dosa is severed on request basis.&#39;,
   u&#39;I had my 4 days in wonderful way however Samriddh and rest of the other stuff was amazing...I am really thrilled to see the entire hospitality of Trident. Good luck to entire team.I will be coming again for sure soon.&#39;,
   u&#34;This business hotel is very well located in BKC. Staff very well behaved and friendly. Always sporting a great smile. Had a very good stay with their personal touch and care in making my room comfortable and looking into the things I needed.Special Mention:Housekeeping staffs - Ashwin &amp; Pooja, who remembered that I liked lemon grass fragrance during my last visit and ensured that I had the same this time as wellHousekeeping Staff - Ketan, who noticed that my personal shaving foam was about to finish and got me a new one as a gift. Thanks!Housekeeping Staff Priyanka - who observed that I work a lot on my laptop and gifted me with a laptop cleaner. Thanks!IRD : Ritesh who rushed at late hours to get me a hot herbal drink without me asking, to heal my bad cough which I had during my last trip. It helped me get some sleep!IRD : Asish, a name I always remember in my trips to this hotel. He has been taking extra care in looking into all my needs, be it missing green tea and coffee sachet in my room, to empty candle carton to light the lemon grass diffuser, to getting me a herbal tea to heal my cough, to enquiring about my health which was not great this time when I was staying in this hotel. Over and above that when I was checking out he on knowing I like banana cakes, gave me a small hamper of banana cakes, along with some wonderful and the best cookies I had ever and some diyas. A very big Thank you to you Asish. Would remember you gesture always!At the end I would like to mention all these wonderful people are part of this great brand called Trident and without their training and grooming, I don&#39;t think they could have been this good. I wish them all the best and surely they are going to do very well in the hospitality Industry!&#34;,
   u&#39;I arrived at 1am on a delayed flight and the airlines had misplaced my bags. The Trident driver stayed until I came out and had cold water and a cold napkin for me to freshen up. Once I got to the hotel, they arranged for toiletries (hair gel, shaving kit, etc) and told me that I could get a shirt from the hotel store that opened at 8am. I got my shirt the next morning and the entire experience was excellent. The breakfast is exceptional!&#39;,
   u&#39;every thing is excellent. at lest on day allow to breakfast to family,\ni like the trident BKC, Your staff also nice. if possible two night stay complementary for my family .Your breakfast is very good..&#39;,
   u&#39;Excellent services. Very friendly staff. One of the best stay. Will highly recommend.\nFood was great too.\nKids friendly.\nProvided transportation to nearby places. Staff brought toys for the kids. Great stay&#39;,
   u&#34;Services has deteriorated due to lack on consistency. Every time the rules gets change for example asked for some particular room but was told that&#39;s a premium room, asked for water and while billing water become chargeable. Ask for tea while breakfast not served, asked to rectify the cable TV being told it will take some time and left as it is,&#34;,
   u&#34;I checked in early due to my visa issues and checked out late. The staff was friendly and responded in a quick and efficient manner. The only problem was the kettle which was unclean and hence we couldn&#39;t use it. Rest this is a very good place to stay with delicious food options as well.&#34;,

  [u&#34;I stayed at the Hyatt Regency last night. The hotel is located next to Terminal 2 near Mumbai Airport. The location is great. What makes it even better is that they offered us a complimentary airport pick up and drop. The check in and check out is smooth. The rooms are functional. The TV placed in the room is small but that&#39;s okay as I only needed to catch up on the news briefly in the morning. One area where Hyatt can improve significantly is hospitality. This morning, we had an early check out and hit the coffee shop for a light breakfast (fruits / muesli). Time was 6am. The breakfast officially opens at 6:30am. The staff were not the most friendly. In any other 5 star property, one can have fruits and Muesli which are already at the counter. Thankfully, the staff at the reception were surprised by this behaviour by the restaurant staff. Obviously, there is a disconnect / communication gap. I hope the hotel management fixes this. You would otherwise not want to use a hotel property which offers poor hospitality. There are just so many better options available - the Taj Santacruz is so much better with better rooms and amazing hospitality. It&#39;s located near Terminal 1. &#34;,
   u&#39;A nice &amp; excellent hotel to visit , very close to International Airport and surrounded by so many other brands of hotel.The choice always remains only Hyatt Regency Mumbai . The restaurants are well maintained, Staff are very courteous. Buffet breakfast is amazing and elaborate . Colorful cutting Chai glasses ,So many juices and choices of breakfast one can spend whole day just relaxing from restaurant to spa to pool to club lounge and very attractive lobby which has a instaphoto booth , lots of local information. Rooms are excellent. A must hotel to stay and enjoy the services&#39;,
   u&#39;It\u2019s my home away from home and something I look forward to each time I visit Mumbai. A big thanks to Sandesh for taking such great care starting with the greeting at the arrival to escorting straight to my room and from time to time a surprise upgrade to an exec room. Keep up the great job you do and I\u2019ll see you yet again, hopefully sooner than later!!!&#39;,
   u&#39;Its located close by Mumbai airport so good for people has flight late night and early morning. Their rooms were designed modern enough. They have also good restaurant in their lobby floor. We enjoyed their crispy pizza and nice imported wines.&#39;,
   u&#39;The reason for writing this review is to congratulate staff at Glasshouse.Staff at Glasshouse was very efficient. In spite of restaurant being full in morning staff was courteous and worked efficiently. The room was comfortable and quiet.&#39;,
   u&#39;First impression was pleasant at reception. When i arrived at my room it smelled like urine, the carpet under the bed was filthy. Being in the second floor, i had access to a business lounge, i could have my breakfast and a snack at dinner time with drinks included. Although the place was comfortable the ambient music was too loud, i had to ask to turn it down a bit. People were bringing the kids so it became noisy again. I few guests showed up in full gym gear still sweating. Not a very special hotel, just average. It needs better cleaning, odour control, noise control.Food was ok.&#39;,
   u&#34;The location is perfect, very close to the airport. Just what one needs for a business trip.I loved the layout of the bathroom the most, highly luxurious. Room was huge, classy and comfortable. Bedding was ok, presentation of the bed was pretty average at first look. Also had a tough time figuring out the master switch for the room lights, eventually gave up. Maybe they can work on that. Did not have time to explore breakfast food options or the property but sure to come back to try !Overall, purely from a business point of view, it&#39;s good to go.&#34;,
   u&#39;I spent an amazing time here with friends in the wee morning hours. I also had an coffee in the coffee shop which was really good and smooth. The lobby is very beautiful and have ample of space to spend time.&#39;,
   u&#39;amazing service and the staff was very helpful and well mannered. The food is great and the breakfast buffet is excellent.The\xa0restaurant\xa0has good\xa0variety\xa0of\xa0veg\xa0&amp; non veg food.my stay with my family was very good and memorable.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Presidential suite at Hyatt Regency Mumbai, with its ultimate luxury, provides an enriching experience. I had booked the suite for a night last week, and I had a fantastic time with my family. The living room is built like a giant dome with many comfortable sofas to relax &amp; just chill. A large tv at one corner is connected to a system with Bose speakers all over the ceiling of the dome, giving amazing auditorium like sound effects. You can connect your mobile/tablet to the system to listen to the music of your choice. A brightly-lit bar adorns one corner of the living room with all the necessary equipment, while a study table is placed at the other corner. A giant dining table with seating for 8 people is at the far end of the room. Next to the dining room is a fully-equipped kitchen. The bedroom has a king-size bed, a sofa, a tv and a recliner with 5 different massage options. The attached bathroom is big &amp; equipped with a Jacuzzi. There are different passages which connect the living room, kitchen and bedroom. Brilliant paintings adorn the walls in all the rooms and the furniture is state-of-the-art. The only problem we faced was that the air-conditioning in the bedroom was not working properly and could not be fixed despite 2 attempts by the housekeeping staff, so we had to keep the bedroom doors open to allow the A/Cs from the living room to cool the bedroom. It was the only hitch to an otherwise perfect experience. The dinner as well as breakfast at the hotel had a big spread with cuisines from across the world. A memorable stay in the lap of luxury.&#39;],

  [u&#39;Worst room I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world - for a so-called five star hotel. Terrible check in processes. Most unwelcoming staff. But for their location, they have nothing to recommend. Will never stay there again.&#39;,
   u&#39;The property is wonderful and you will get the proper four seasons hospitality you would expect to get at any hotel within that exceptional chain. The lady at the concierge was very helpful with all the planning and she was very thoughtful to give my friend and I an Indian scarf that we can wear with our Kurtas. The rooftop terrace is a must visit at sunset! &#39;,
   u&#39;Was here for business for 2 weeks and the staff make you feel at home and are very lovely to speak to and always ask if they can help you and do more for you. I love the surprise gifts I would find in my room every couple of days especially when it was Diwali I loved that we got to experience and celebrate this festival with them.&#39;,
   u&#39;Our driver drove us from our Taj Hotel to the Four Seasons. In the three weeks in India this was the most thrilling place we experienced as far as a modern venue. The hotel is amazing and riding the elevator is a piece of theater. From the landing you still have to climb a couple of sets of stairs all adding to the fun of finally ARRIVING at the Lounge. What a view and what a beautifully designed space. While we were there it happened that there was a ban on alcohol, no matter! We had the flatbread pizza and a dessert. Wonderful. All the young people on staff were engaging which added to the fun of being on the top of Mumbai. BTW we are 71 and 73 years old and the bar is not just for youngsters to enjoy!!!&#39;,
   u&#39;I was not expecting my stay at the Four Seasons in Mumbai to be anything special, but the personal service at this Hotel was brilliant. I dont think I have ever been to another hotel around the world, where the staff were completely attentive to your needs and where numerous levels of staff knew your name and used it in a welcoming manner.&#39;,
   u&#39;What a great hotel, staff is extremely friendly, a very warm welcome. The room was nice, especially the bed. Very comfortable and we enjoyed the swimming pool very much. The rooftop bar is amazing, unfortunately they can\u2019t serve alcohol anymore due to some new policies in Mumbai. However it was a very pleasant stay. &#39;,
   u&#34;It was the one of the best Hotel we stayed in during our trip to Hong Kong, Singapore and Goa. Fantastic customer service experience during our stay, so much so that I cancelled my bother&#39;s hotel that he booked in Mumbai so I can book him and his family in to 4 Season.&#34;,
   u&#39;Best hotel I have every been in to!! Perfect People, Perfect rooms and Perfect food. Have been there for only 2 nights, but cannot deny that the hotel made a big impression on me and the other members of our group&#39;,
   u&#39;Awesome Hotel, Professional staff and with a warm hospitable attitude and feel. Very Pro-active approach to needs and requests. Front Desk Stars Karthik &amp; Aditiya. WC must cater to Asian/ Indian guests&#39;,

  [u&#39;I\u2019ve stayed here twice in the past two months on my visit to Mumbai. Quintessential Taj Hospitality!! The hotel is spacious with a lot of space to walk around, eating options many, rooms are spacious and well maintained, views from the room are mind blowing. The service standard and quality is out of this world- efficient, smooth, considerate and very professional. However there are a few things that may need improvement- A) the floors were quite noisy on account of the ongoing renovation, and also some very noisy residents who shrieked the place down at 4-5am. B) as mentioned earlier, pls introduce access control for residential floors, as presently anyone can walk up to the room in the middle of the night. &#39;,
   u&#39;I was expecting a bit normal old property, but once inside the lobby it was an amazing impression. The staff at front desk is quite friendly and understand all your needs. My suite room facing sea had a wonderful view. The rooms are very well furnished full of all required amenities. The housekeeping staff of hotel is ever ready to meet all requirements instantly. The butler service boy was extraordinary skilled to handle all your needs and make the stay more comfortable. The inroom dining experience was something different as they serve you prompt tasty food customised same way as the chef prepares as per guided requirements. I wish to congratulate the hotel GM for best administration among other Taj I frequently stay like old heritage palace or the one with Runway view santacruj by TS &amp; S. The club lounge at 21 level has wonderful view and well equipped. The entire hotel staff is very friendly &amp; cooprative. Still I think I forget to comment any area&#39;,
   u&#39;We stayed at the lands end for a staycation during the diwali week.. The staff was very hospitable but did it adhere to the Taj standards of hospitality, the answer is no.. The reason why I have loved Taj beyond all hotels is the staff of none of the other five stars could come close to Taj, however this time it felt like any other five star. Second issue was the room. We had booked a club room. The room felt outdated and like any other standard room albeit a little bigger.. Ming yang used to be my favourite Chinese restaurant in the city. However this time I felt that the quality had gone down. The positives. The view from the room was to die for.. The view from the club premiere room was outstanding (though trident in Mumbai offers the same view with better food and drinks).. The lunch buffet at Vista stood up to the high standards of Taj.. The check in an check out was smooth.. All I can say is that it is a worth it business hotel but would I indulge in another staycation here. Probably no.. &#39;,
   u&#39;The venue by the bay is really exotic..\nGet a sea facing room and watch the waves..\nRooms are neat and bathrooms are excellently decorated and spotless..\nFood quality, service and hospitality is good..\nReally enjoyed my stay..&#39;,
   u&#39;Facing Arabian Sea this luxury hotel is one of the oldest properties of taj hotels in Mumbai. Very spacious lobby and attractive restaurants. Food is delicious. Try fish curry with steamed rice and rasmalai.&#39;,
   u&#39;We were recently at the Taj Lands End in Bandra, Maharashtra in India and cannot tell you how amazing of a hotel it is. The staff was very friendly the check in was smooth and quick. They have an amazing bar/lounge in the hotel which we took to as out local. Even though the hotel is old it feels so luxurious inside the rooms were big and packed with amenities and all modern furniture &amp; fixtures. The pool is good however could do with an upgrade at the poolside bar. All in all its such a nice hotel with the shopping district of linking road only a few minutes by Rickshaw away. Highly recommended for families and couples&#39;,
   u&#39;I just want to share my stay at Taj . This was an unforgettable experience and I would highly recommended Taj to all my friends and family. You have the most friendly and very helpful staffs, they never hesitate for one minute to do anything and they are forever ready to help, there is absolutely nothing that I can say was not good at Taj. Thank you Shivi Tandoon for being such a great host starting from check in until check out she made us feel that we are just in our own country. Food was amazing such a wide variety and the service in the restaurant was excellent. I will for sure visit again and recommend Taj to all my families and friends&#39;,
   u&#34;Extended stay from Dec 22, 2016 thru Feb 7, 2017. Very nice quiet location. Room with ocean view was fantastic. Luxurious and spacious - bedroom/bathroom with shower/tub. Nephew was able to procure room thru his contact with Riddhi Chundawat, Asst Sales Manager. Professional and knowledgeable. She was itching for greener pastures and if she has flown the coop, new employer will have found a gem !!!! Everyone in Guest Services (Insha Mukri) took care of my needs. Fruits, cookies and chocolates helped late night cravings while I worked. Had to share with private driver and Aunt&#39;s housekeeper !!!! Chocolate Souffle last week was to die for !!!! Kudos to kitchen staff. Veronica and another young lady (horribly embarrassed I have forgotten her name) took care of my wake up calls. Restaurant staff during breakfast remembered my favorites. Yes, you have to tip everyone as staff survive on tips. Internet is slow so you have to work around it. Hotel is expensive but is in a secluded area yet convenient to airport. Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan live close by so expect to see tourist buses and fans from early AM till midnight hoping to see them !!!! Planning a trip again for nephew&#39;s wedding and definitely plan to stay there again.&#34;,
   u&#39;No words.... Taj Lands End is one of the best hotels in the Mumbai suburbs. From outside its seem to be normal other hotels, once you inside its an amazing experience, warm welcome at the entrance, friendly and understanding staff.The room service was quite fast and it dosent make me feel like i m not comfortable, well trained staff is one of the best which i havent found in other hotels. The didning experience and quick food service by chef its impressive.I personally recommend if you want to stay a hotel. dont miss this one It has great connectivity to the business hubs and international airport and many parts of the city&#39;,
   u&#34;Excellent location (I&#39;ve always gotten to enjoy great sea views here) in Mumbai&#39;s charming (and trendy) neighborhood of Bandra. This was my third stay here over a two year-period, and the experience has been consistently great. Let&#39;s not forget the staff of the hotel, especially at the reception. Everything from arrival till departure was excellent as expected.&#34;],

  [u&#34;What a beautiful hotel! I only wish I&#39;d had more time to explore all the bars and restaurants. The food was fantastic, the staff super attentive, and the rooms sumptuous and lovely. I even took advantage of a massage at the spa very late in the evening before my 2am flight - what a great way to pass the time before departure.&#34;,
   u&#39;I stayed at Sofitel on both business and leisure with my family. My expectations were not so high as I think going in unrealistic expectations always leads to disappointment. I stayed in a Junior suit and had the full airport service thrown in. The taxi was on time when I landed at Mumbai. The driver was presented well and spoke fluent English that help create a conversation with him. The car was very clean with refreshments. Our check in was seamless. We were escorted to our room and was shown all the facilities and the porter checked we were happy otherwise move us to something else, which I thought was very personal To end on a positive the staff at this hotel were the reason we would recommend this hotel, from the breakfast teams to business lounge workers who worked tirelessly to ensure we enjoyed every minute in the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure trips. I look forward to coming back next year. &#39;,

   u&#39;Nice experience with good staff and prompt service response. Good location with well connected to all suburbs. Well groomed and trained staff to handle queries. I personally recommend to be here while in Mumbai.&#39;,
   u&#39;Sofitel is a very good luxury hotel in Mumbai. Though the room is small but the interiors and presence of big bath tub makes it look premium. The choice of restaurants is good especially the one serving south India cuisine. &#39;,

It was highly recommended to me by a colleague, All the staff are so friendly, front staff was really helpful but I must mention Dinesh and Kristene the concierge, So knowledgeable and extremely helpful in aiding us plan our time in Mumbai.

  [u&#34;The room was dirty, the floor smells. the price for meal or drinks was extremle expensive. (beer about 7 Euro). no reaction of the managment on the blames. I&#39; was with a groupe with some people and all of them complained!&#34;,
   u&#39;Amazing place great Hospitality offer by the hotel.great place to be and equally good value for money.do ho for their buffets and brunch you will love it.i t is located in one of plush localities of mumbai .it is a bit expensive though.&#39;,
   u&#39;It is rare to see a so much horrible hotel at this price. I would rather say I have never seen so much dirty hotel.The rooms are not cleaned, I do not even speak about the smelling...The view on the sea is quite fair but the beach dirty.Please avoid this hotel...&#39;,
   u&#39;Situated on the Juhu beach, its an Average property.The location is the obvious good part about the Hotel.If your room is Sea facing, its a great view of course.However, the maintainence of the property can certainly be better. I understand that the outer facade is difficult owing the Sea and its effects.Its the interiors which need a facelift.Its very average, even for higher category rooms which provide Executive lounge access.Nothing is bad, but everything is just Okayish.There is no wow factor.Even the service needs to get better.Hallmarks of this Industry is Customer delight and Hospitality towards them.The Upholstery, washrooms, Bed- all can be a two notches better for the Prices charged.Even the food at The Square and the Italian one, i didnt try Baggecha- were Average&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed 2 Night and 3 days in the property.While making the booking request I had request for a best clear sea view room.My overall experience of this property and its service is disappointing.It is a very busy hotel the staff at all customer service area are robotic and lack understanding of customer centric service.The rooms and most of the fixture in and around hotel looks tired and needs some maintainance.My room view was a complete let down.The location of the property has the advantage of sea view but due overall poor maintainance of the ambiance and tired looking service.I will not recommend.&#39;,
   u&#39;we stayed on our transit to south although we were in executive room the room size is pretty small,hotel is very busy the breakfast area is crowded and restaurent is not spic and span too gloomy and needs a renovation its a bit run down ,the pool service is bad take 45 minutes for an order.but for the price you pay and if you are going to be out the whole day its ok for relaxation not the right place&#39;,
   u&#39;The best part about the hotel is that it\u2019s a beach facing property. The restaurants and some of the rooms have a clear sea view and with wind blowing through the palm trees, it\u2019s a pretty sight and almost makes up for the high rates they charge you. However, what was a little disappointing was that the hotel needs renovation. They have worked on the lobby and the restaurants; however once u go up towards the room areas, u realize that the place needs an uplift. The upholstery and furniture in the room is clean, yet it lacks the finesse of what is expected from a five star hotel and for the price u pay. The room size is small and the bathroom is even smaller. &#39;,
   u&#39;The property is located on Juhu Beach, which is awesome. The service at times is pathetic. The rooms need maintenance and house keeping was never prompt. Many of the facilities like swimming pool were just average. &#39;,
   u&#39;ProsStandard Novotel hotel as per their global standardGood location with beach access and access to mumbai northRooms are good with good amenities inside roomGood food and nice breakfast spreadVery cosy setup and comfortable Right pricing considering prime locationConsSlightly old property&#39;,
   u&#39;I was very disappointed. I came to celebrate Diwali in this hotel. Stayed 5 nights from 17th to 21st Oct 2017. No lights, no divas, no happy Diwali wishes, no decorations no sweeta nothing. Indians working in that hotel should be ashamed of themselves not to celebrate Diwali. I had to change the room very next day with the issues of shower. Staff very polite but management had no idea of guest relationship. Sorry but never again I will stay in this hotel. I would rate it as 3 star only.&#39;],

  [u&#39;Our flight was delayed for a number of hours but the hotel transfer proved very reliable. The hotel is located in close proximity to the airport which made for a simple arrival and departure. Hotel staff were welcoming and helpful. Assistance/translating to acquire a SIM card and ordering OLA Taxis (the Indian Uber equivalent) was provided. The breakfast served on rooftop terrace were varied from day to day with traditional Indian choices, including omelettes and fresh fruit juice. The rooms are relatively spacious and clean. We felt secure and safe in this hotel.Having traveled a lot internationally this hotel may seem very basic to some western travellers. Inexpensive furnishing and finishes and some wear and tear are a part of the package. The neighbourhood is full of a population who are going about their lives. No sidewalks, crazy traffic and all sorts of bustling humanity. None of the hustling that one can experience in the Old City tourist centres of some large cities. We ate some delicious, simple vegetarian meals in unassuming nearby restaurants. Zomato is a good review app for dining options. &#39;,
   u&#39;We stayed in the Accord for a family getaway to see a bit more of Mumbai. The hotel was nice and comfortable. I booked it through OYO. It is a bit away from the main attractions of Mumbai, but close to the airport. The room I had was nice though a bit of a squeeze with an extra bed(We were 3 of us), but we were happy to manage as the room was neat and had the clean bathroom. Food was served in the room on order by friendly staff members.Breakfast was included and they had a changing menu which was reasonably nice. The Staff handling breakfast were a bit stiff-lipped, though.&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed with the hotel for 12 days , It was an amazing experience, staff were great ... We had no complaints and it was so nice of them to celebrate Diwali with us ... Rooms are Neat and tidy and staff are very friendly...&#39;,
   u&#39;De &#34;deluxe&#34; room is not &#34;deluxe&#34; at all. Don\&#39;t trust the photos. They didn\&#39;t pick me up at the airport although I sent them 4 e-mails. They don\&#39;t clean the room if you don\&#39;t leave the key at reception, which is weird. Lack of variety for breakfast. Average and comfortable room. Good location.&#39;,
   u&#39;I am impressed by the ambience and hospitality. They taken utmost care from reception at the arrival of Mumbai Airport. All staffs are helpful and supportive. complimentary break fast is satisfactory, It is nearer to Santacruz station and domestic as well as International Airport. Juhu Beach is only 3 Km. but far from the Gateway of India (nearly 30 Km). I strongly recommended the hotel for family trips.&#39;,
   u&#39;Excellent for the value collected, compared to the market value for the same size of accommodation in a metropolitan city. Surely recommended to persons who are travelling to Mumbai on personal expenses&#39;,
   u&#34;We stayed in eco room for 2 nights. Rooms are old but they renovated it and it looks good. It&#39;s very close to the domestic airport and Santa Cruz Railway Station. Breakfast buffet at the terrace is average and they have set menu for all weeks day. Thought they have very limited things in bfast but it&#39;s yummy. Room service, Wi-Fi etc are good. They also provide free pickup from airport. Overall good stay in limited budget. &#34;,
   u&#39;The hotel is undergoing renovation, it may be of inconvenience to some guests but it is very conveniently located near the airport. The food was awesome. They provide free airport drop and pick up. Value for money hotel for a break journey&#39;,
   u&#34;The hotel was booked by my office people but for the four days I stayed in Mumbai I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel staff were polite and caring. The rooms were cleaned everyday. The room - even though a bit small for my taste - was nicely decorated and had all the amenities one could think of. Another major advantage is that it is only 3 kms from the Airport and stone&#39;s throw from Santa Cruz (E) station and Western Expressway making it highly advantageous for Mumbai travels. The station road gives access to various shops and eating places. So you don&#39;t have to solely rely on hotel food. Easy accessibility and good rooms makes this hotel much recommended. But I would not recommend it for family stay as it is mostly frequented by business travellers and foreign tourists.&#34;,
   u&#34;The hotel is a 15 minute drive from the domestic as well as the International Airport.It is a small hotel with smaller rooms.Bathroom was very average.Hotel needs a makeover real soon.There was a stink in the hotel.We reached midnight and still the check in was smooth.Went there only for 7 hours just to sleep,so can&#39;t write much but the bed was okay and the breakfast was served in the room which was quite tasty.Other than that,not much to write about this hotel.Not worth 3500/- a night!Can be avoided as there are other options for same price available in Bandra and Santa Cruz/Vile Parle.Will I go back?No is the answer.&#34;],

  [u&#39;Stayed here for a week with the family in late October. Noticeable how many staff there are in comparison to European hotels and provides for excellent service which was both friendly and efficient. The bedrooms are well appointed with very good views. Endless supply of bottled water in the rooms which was very handy. The seven kitchens restaurant delivered incredible variety at breakfast therefore you could have anything from a delicious masala dosa to bacon and eggs or continental style cuisine. The hotel sits directly above a high end shopping centre, which also has a good choice of restaurants and a food hall, therefore you can stock up on various items if you so wish. The gym had lots of equipment and the outside pool on the 10th floor was great for catching the morning and lunchtime sunshine. Great hotel and would definitely go again &#39;,
   u&#39;Mr Manohar throughout my short stay was excellent personality he made the room available when it was not with special arrangements I would like to come back always because of Mr Chawla thank you for your kind hospitality you have made my stay memorable&#39;,
   u&#34;This is a fabulous hotel. One if the nicest I have stayed in. Nice decor, rooms were spacious and comfy, with large bathroom. Restaurant open 24hrs which was handy as I checked in very late and was feeling hungry and didn&#39;t fancy ordering room service. There was a butler on my floor but I did not have time to fully utilise the service. A shame I only spent a night. Hoping to have a longer stay next time.&#34;,
   u&#39;Get ready to be pampered with excellent service, elegance, and superb dining. I stayed for 2 nights, in a suite, and found the room to be a den of zen. Clean, sleek, peaceful, with excellent wifi and amenities. The butler service was unparalleled. The buffet breakfast at Seven Kitchens was unlike any other - with freshly-made dishes, a variety of breads, cheeses, condiments, and foods of different ethnicities. The same goes for dinner. I also tasted the best thai green curry ever, at the MeKong restaurant. The grand drawing room on the 9th floor will take you to another time and space. A lovely moment to treasure. Finally, the staff was superb, in terms of politeness, service and attention to detail. All with a genuine smile.&#39;,
   u&#39;Had drinks and dinner at the St. Regis and spent an unforgettable evening with Stefan playing all our favorites - new and old - on the piano. Hope we\u2019ll see him again soon - at the Regis or on a cinema screen somewhere! Thanks for wonderful food and great entertainment!&#39;,
   u&#39;St. Regis has all the typical amenities one would expect from a great 5 star hotel in India. Buffet has the widest selection of international and Indian cuisine and bar choices are ample too. They also offer a great room service with a decent choice of international and local food items. Butler service for rooms is a very unique concept. Rooms are very spacious and that itself is a big luxury to have that too in South Mumbai. Check in process in very smooth and the staff across every function at St. Regis is very courteous.&#39;,
   u&#39;Fantastic as usual. Same consistent breakfast with so many option to select. Don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve stop serving alcohol at Asilo the roof top bar. Good cleanliness in rooms and friendly staff specially the Butler service is bonus. &#39;,
   u&#39;Amazing hotel and service!!!Once in a lifetime experience!!!Special thanks to the head butler shakir and our personal butler preetum! Because of you our stay was incredible! Moria shahar &amp; Lihi frider &#39;,
   u&#39;I Checked Into This Hotel With My Wife &amp; 2Kids On 14Th Oct 2017 For 2Nights But From The Time We Got Down From The Car At The Porch Till The Time We Were Getting Back Into The Car After The Checkout, I Must Say The Experience Has Been Awesome/Overwhelming/Outstanding(Cant Remember Anymore Expressions) Usually I Dont Write Much Reviews Since I Dont Get Much Impressed By The Hotels So Easily.But With The Kind Of Service We Received From This Hotel Right From The Valet, The Reception(During Checkinn), Especially The Butlet Mr.Chirag Gosavi(5Plus Stars For The Him) He Explained Us Each &amp; Everything About The Hotel\&#39;s Ammenities, Their Outlets, Their Butler Service, 2Thumps Up For His Patience To Explain Us All This In Detail.When We Went For Dinner In Their Oneof The Restaurant &#34;Seven Kitchen&#34; Where We Met Mr.Hemant(Even 5Stars For Him Too) Who Is One Of The Manager Of That Outlet. Even He Took Great Care Of Us. Since My Kids Were Also Accompanying Us Mr,Hemant Made Sure That The Kids Are Served With Their Favourite Dishes &amp; Their Favourite Soft Drinks.During The Meal He Used To Come To Us &amp; Used To Suggest Thier Most Popular Dishes Which We Had Not Tried From The Buffet Till Then.I Also Observed That All The Staff In The Whole Hotel Was So Attentive That If Of The Guest Is Sitting Alone/Idle Then They Used To Go To That Guest &amp; Used To Chat With That Guest Just To Make Sure The Guest Is Not Getting Bored/Or Felling Lonely (Which I Liked The Most)I Liked Thier Super-Friendly Approach Which Was Not Too Much &amp; Not Even Less.I Have Been To Most Of The Branded 3Star-5Star Hotels But In Most Of The Hotels I Have Observed The Staff There Just Used To Do Thier Duty &amp; Thats It, Whileas Here It Was Not The Same, They Used To Make Sure That Everything Is Taken Care &amp; If Required They Whould Go Out Of The Way To Make A Guest Feel More Than Just Satsified.They Also Have So Many Different Kinds Of Outlets Right From Cafes, To Restaurants, To Spa To Salon To Swimming Pools Etc Plus It Is Just Next To The Very Well Know &amp; The Best Mall Of Mumbai.Haah!!!!! Cant Get Tired Of Praising Them.I Serioulsy Dont Know How Do I Thank The Whole Team Of St.Regis But Can Just Sayhatsoff To Team St Regis. I Also Feel There Should Have Been More Hotels Like This Pan India &amp; Abroad.Feels Great To Share This Review.....Thank You&#39;,

  [u&#39;Good service execellent breakfast and also good rooms.Only good for business stay.Good size rooms and bathroom and only disappointment is no shower gel or shampoo.Also not being provided with daily bottle of water ,have to ask for it otherwise no complaints.&#39;,
   u&#34;Pros: Staff are good.Good connectivity with Metro and all other areas.Wifi was always workingFood are available at midnight to but don&#39;t expect it to be very tasty.Cons: Breakfast was not good on all the 5 days which we stayedRooms have AC which you cannot OFF at any point else your room will get filled with water.&#34;,
   u&#39;As a business traveler, Convenient place to stay if want to be in approach to in and around customers in Andheri,Vile Parle, Santacruz are and Airport.Old hotel but rooms are good but Bathrooms are smaller -Food is good with reasonably good service.Most of Taxi driver are not aware from Airport area.

   u&#34;I came to Mumbai for some dental work and a bit of a look around as I&#39;d never been to India before. I chose Residency because of its reviews in this forum. Overall it does hit the mark in most areas, but falls short on a couple.Let me start by saying, that if you are in Mumbai for business and you are looking for accomodation in this price band then Hotel Residency is a perfect fit.If like me you are here for a tiki tour then this may not be the place for you.Front desk check in ok. Efficient without being overjoyed to welcome you.I had a room on the 7th floor (701). Aircon and spacious. Good size room but if you leave the aircon off for a bit you can smell a mustiness that can become overpowering.Food is great. I&#39;m from New Zealand and found the menu to be awesome. European breakfast and dinner options available.No probs getting taxis as there is a stand outside the hotel.I stayed for a week before moving on. In summary this hotel is for the business men and woman. All the comforts and details of a tourist hotel are not here, as apparent by its proximity to the tourist hotspots.I had a good stay, but had to catch at least 4 taxis every day to get around. Not a complaint, but a tip for others (outside India)who are looking for good accomodation closer to tourist areas.&#34;,
   u&#39;Comfortable place to stay and ideally located, good staff always helpful. A decent business hotel which is well maintained and is easily connected with all parts of Mumbai - near to airport, adjacent to metro station and very near to Andheri local station. Food is owsem....&#39;,
   u&#39;It was a nice experience staying at Residency Hotel.. recommend to my friends .. The best part is big size rooms &amp; central AC.Very good food at comfortable rates.It is centrally located near to airport.&#39;,
   u&#34;I stayed here on a business trip for three nights in May. The hotel is in easy reach of the airport and is well located for the metro and main roads too.The rooms are of a good size and clean and relatively well maintained.Breakfast was perfectly acceptable but there&#39;s not loads of variety if you&#39;re looking for something non-Indian. I love my Indian breakfasts so I was quite happy.Customer service was good and responsive. They changed my room quickly after a problem with the aircon in my room.&#34;,
   u&#39;Good can turn very good n other way round it could go an average. Residency hotel is an example of how good can become an average hotel.Good location, good rooms with basic amenities, but....We were provided only 2 towels, no small or hand towel , one of the towel was over used, warn out and with hanging threads, I called up house keeping, asked to change the towel n provide hand towel, which they did promptly, later on I show extra cover on the bed was torn n had hole of more than 2 inches n so was one of pillow cover with a hole of an inch, I photographed them to show it to reception.I believe this is a regular practice, of hoteliers specially for those guests who have booked through portal, Our room was booked through &#34;Yatra&#34;, last March I had similar experience, at varanasi where I was given torn n stiched towel.Next morning, complimentary breakfast was okay.All concerned hotel staff members were cooperative.&#39;,
   u&#39;Very Good. Awesome and highly recommended. Rooms are Awesome and the service is also very good. Booking through trip advisor is very much recommended as they provide some good deals and right tariff..............................................&#39;,
   u&#39;Stayed at this place on the night of 9th May 2017.Positives1. Pretty close to airport... just 20 minutes if traffic is light2. Tariff is reasonable3.

   u&#39;The hotel is a landmark of sorts, sitting right at the end of Marine Drive at Nariman Point. Its conveniently located in the south, and has a friendly warm staff. The hotel itself is in need of an renovation / overhaul, since the age shows through in the rooms / bath rooms and public areas though it is well maintained and clean. Breakfast can get crowded, due to the sheer number of guests and rooms in the hotel, but once you get the table, the food is just fine. Staff is courteous and the service good.&#39;,
   u&#39;We had an awesome stay at the Trident. The staff in every department are courteous and always ready to go that extra mile. The breakfast was sumptuous!My son loved the courtesy drop in the Mini Cooper.Thanks for making our Mumbai trip such a memorable one!&#39;,
   u&#39;It is an amazing place ! The staff here is good and food also tastes delicious. :)Pool is situated at a beautiful place where you can just relax and enjoy the scene of entire Marine Lines. Helpful staff with and good security!&#39;,
   u&#34;Beautiful place to stay at Mumbai...prime location. Just walk out to marine drive at any part of the day. Most of the important landmarks and visiting sites are within walking distance. Front line even number rooms give a great sea side view, Food has been delicious catering for everyone&#39;s taste buds. Lifts appear to be in less than adequate numbers....waiting time may be prolonged at time. Rooms do not have electric iron and iron boards....may not be available when you need them the most.Overall a good experience....will be excellent if these problems are rectified.&#34;,
   u&#34;This is an excellent hotel. The rooms are beautiful with everything you need. All the staff are most helpful ,it&#39;s has a calm atmosphere in the middle of Mumbai. There was a good selection for breakfast with fruit ,omelette pancakes cereal as well as hot buffet with both European and Indian food to choose from. Would highly recommend.&#34;,
   u&#39;We had been gone to trident nariman point mumbai on the special occassion of my fatgers birthday and we also got to meet cricket stars and we had celebrated the fathers birthday at best. The hotel along with restaurant indiana jones made it just awesome they had given us cake in a surprise way. I would like to thank deepali mathur(duty manager), hoosang(concierge), cyrus(gym trainer) &amp; krutika(staff membe). The chef Jitu Phukan of the indiana jones restaurant and sanket (staff member) . They all cooperate with us and also helped us in many ways.&#39;,
   u&#39;We stayed one night here as part of a Gate 1 tour group. Excellent hotel, with great service. Nice large rooms, quiet, with excellent wifi. We had a group dinner in the hotel and after two weeks touring all over India it was the best food we had. The chefs do an excellent job. As we had an early flight to Nepal the hotel created a breakfast box for us to take away. Fabulous service. Wifi was free and good as well.&#39;,

  [u&#39;I am here for 5 nights. This is a basic hotel (no frills) but I like it because everything works. Internet is free and good connection. Air conditioning works perfectly (I like it cold). Room is clean with a refrigerator. TV has many channels (USA &amp; Indian). The breakfast buffet is truly wonderful (about US$35 for 5 days). I eat a huge breakfast and this lasts me until dinner. I can work very efficiently in my room. For dinner, I had fish curry and garlic nan (around US$10) and it was the nicest fish curry of my life. My waiter, Ganesh, kept getting me bits to eat from the dinner buffet while I waited for my fish curry - all without charge. I think the dinner buffet (also huge) is around US$20; I think it is probably worth it. I arrived at 4 a.m. at the International Terminal, the car sent by hotel costs me US$17 - which I thought was a little high for such a short trip. I now realize that Uber workers here. I opened Uber on my phone and everything looked perfect. So, next time, I would use Uber for transportation. I think (???) the hotel car is free if going to the domestic terminal (not sure about this). I like this hotel. I am happy here. I would definitely come back.&#39;,
   u&#34;IBIS is an excellent hotel for a quick business visit. It took less than 10 mins to and from the International Airport.Unfortunately and surprisingly there is no free airport pick-up/ shuttle except from the domestic airport. The added service is about INR 1,100 (US$ 17). The Prepaid Taxi counter from the airport quoted INR 300 for air-conditioned taxi. Unfortunately, their credit card machine didn&#39;t &#39;connect&#39; and I ended up going to another pre-paid taxi counter which charged INR 800 for a distance of less than 4Km!However, my disappointment was short-lived as from the hotel security at the front door onward, I could tell the service was going to be above par. The front desk was so welcoming and made sure I was properly briefed re. my facilities. So much so, the front office staff walked with me to the coffee shop and poured me a cappuccino as I had arrived on a 02:10am flight. Brilliant!The smoking room I requested was in super condition; the room was well lit, fragrant and cool with the toilet in pristine condition. The shower cubicle was spacious and immaculate to say the least.The restaurant had a decent selection for breakfast. Lunch and dinner options were good but limited to a fussy traveler like me... but hey, this is a business hotel and I was flying out in less than 24 Hrs. Didn&#39;t even have time to enjoy the comfy bed and pillows for too long in worry of missing my 11:00 am meeting and flight at 3:00am; though I managed to squeeze in 6 showers in the high pressure shower... Bliss!&#34;,
   u&#34;We stayed there after a mid night arrival at Mumbai airport. Staff is very cooperative &amp; hotel is in great conditions with all the amenities for a short stay. Room view is not that great but you won&#39;t need to open if it is a short stay :P&#34;,
   u&#39;This was the second time was staying at IBIS Mumbai airport and stay was for 5 nights on a business trip. The hotel did not disappoint - flawless &amp; efficient rooms which you can expect in an IBIS brand. I had my business meetings in Goregaon - East and the location of this hotel is amazing, since you are going against the traffic in morning and evening, so you save on travel time. Room sizes are typical IBIS style - added to that, this is heart of Mumbai, so do not expect anything more than the basic space to move to your bed, desk and bathroom. But for a business traveller like me who left the hotel at 8 am and returned at 8pm, that was fine. The highlight of this stay was the excellent restaurant service. I reached out to Chef Rizwan at the restaurant, requesting for some home cooked, low spice food and he obliged for every single meal. Now for a frequent business traveller - that is a big big plus point to get meals which are tasty and to your palate. Thank you Chef Rizwan ! Overall a very business friendly and hassle free stay.&#39;,
   u&#39;A no nonsense business hotel. A comfortable yet luxurious stay. The food tastes good and the spread of the buffet is pretty decent according to the price. As it\u2019s a business hotel, there are not much services available. So pretty much stay the night and eat is the thing to do, if ur purpose to stay there is not business.&#39;,
   u&#39;Room sizes are very small. I feel Room and food are priced on the higher side for the size of the room and the food they serve. This is only a 3-star property, not 5-star property. We have to give money deposit or pay at the time of service itself at the restaurant or in-house dining or other services. Their breakfast starts at 4am but you will receive only muffins and corn flakes. Nobody cares to serve water. They provide free wifi and airport drop.&#39;,
   u&#34;The hotel&#39;s distance from the airport makes it convenient for short stayovers and business trips, The rooms and washroom were neat though a little smaller than expected. The staff was exceptionally courteous and co-operative.&#34;,
   u&#39;I stayed at ibis Mumbai airport hotel recently and had a wonderful stay. The location is just perfect and reached the hotel in 2 minutes from the airport.Rooms are clean and wifi is complimentary. Breakfast had lots of varieties and they were serving hot Dosas and parathas made fresh in front of you. Overall an amazing stay&#39;,
   u&#39;Stayed here for 2 nights must say that the hotel staff is very friendly accommodative and always ready to help. Breakfast was good and rooms were very comfortable.Airport is very nearby and closest mall is Oberois mall which is also superb&#39;,
   u&#39;Good location near the hotels. Rooms and bathroom too small for the price and competition available nearby. Breakfast and service very good. staff very hospitable. no complaints. should provide transport facility for International guest&#39;],

  [u&#39;Near to airport, But supporting staff not so supportive .. Be ready to carry your luggage to your room as nobody will be there to show your room ,breakfast and dinner is just above average. Even though variety is there in breakfast taste is oridinary. Too much of crowd because of conferences conducted there.Even one instance we went to room then found out that magnetic key was working.. Again went to front desk to reactivate the key&#39;,
   u&#39;I attended my cousins product launch / Birthday party earlier this month.. Food and banqueting facilities were amazing.. Special thanks to Mr Sagar Bosmia for his seamless corporation and magnificent hospitality and ensure a sucessfull event for us..&#39;,
   u&#39;The food was great and the environment was just to great, Additionally Magician came to entertain the group.Specially Dal Makkhni, Chicken Bhunna, Nalli Goush and Ajwani Paratha.It was so impressive that now we are going to hold the wedding at Sahara Star in one of the biggest Grand ballroom in the city.&#39;,
   u&#39;I recently did an event at Sahara Star and I must mention that I was pleasantly surprised at the service and the overall experience of the Hotel. Special mention for Dr Pinky Bharadwaj who is one of the most hard working person I have met and is always there to help. Im looking forward to working with Sahara Star again.&#39;,
   u&#39;We had our corporate meeting at the hotel. Not only did they ensure things were taken care of , they went an extra mile to serve our requests.The team headed by the GM is dedicated to customer service and warm. The food and beverages are tasty and cooked to perfection. &#39;,
   u&#39;Located just opposite to Airport in the heart of the city.Rooms facing inner dome are stunning with tropical gardens. Try authentic Maratha cuisine at Ala carte dining. Beautiful lounge for business meetings.&#39;,
   u&#39;It\u2019s an amazing hotel, Services are very good, Nothing to worry when you are here... It\u2019s restaurant\u2019s are also very good, Food at Namak and E.A.S.T Restaurant is outstanding...Reservations can be better but because of Rishi and Fatema there is nothing to worry everything is perfect. &#39;,
   u&#39;our couple to stay in sahara star hotel in one night stay but all experience is very excelent and great and food is very good very clean hotel staff is very very honest to it and this hotel is very good and excelent hotel.&#39;,
   u&#39;We had our corporate event in Sahara Star. One word &#34;Fantabulous&#34;, beautiful hotel, professional staff &amp; great food. I would like to personally thank Dr. Pinky Bhardwaj, she was a great help throughout the event. She was always available on just one call. Would definitely recommend Sahara Star hotel for organizing any kind of event, do contact Dr. Pinky for the same she will make your event a success.&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed at Sahara Star Hotel yesterday night. The entire experience from check in to check out has been great. I loved the In dinning food that I ordered and also the room - very clean and well done. Today morning unfortunately I left my wallet in hotel and the Duty Manager promptly communicated on what\u2019s app and informed me with sharing photos and also supported in terms of how to get my valuable. This level of service is exemplary and represents high level of honest and integrity of the entire Sahara Star hotel. I am very thankful and grateful. &#39;],

  [u&#34;Came here due to a business trip for 4 days!The security and safety of the hotel was great butler service on my floor was top!The staff was all trying their best to please and provide their best service and of course me typical Singaporean must lower my expectation of their efficiency.But nevertheless I am impressed with the cleanliness and service of the hotel which I didn&#39;t least expect it!Overall thumbs up!!&#34;,
   u&#39;I am a frequent traveller having the opportunity to visit mumbai repeatedly every year this October was back at the oberoi mumbai at nariman point and like every time this was a fantastic experience, bespoke rooms, world class amenities an ambience par excellence gourmet cuisine and avant garde service would go no where else to stay the staff makes you feel very special I have stayed in some of the world finest hotels but this one is over the top Abhijat sharma&#39;,
   u&#39;We had a very enjoyable one night stay at the Oberoi. We had a premium sea view room which had a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea and city, and an extremely comfy bed (and pillow menu). The rooms are relatively small in comparison with other places we stayed in India and the breakfast buffet could have had a little more choice.During our stay, we booked a Heritage walk through the hotel and our guide was Laxmi. The walk was definitely worth it and Laxmi was a wonderful guide - very knowledgable, friendly and went out of her way to give us a flavour of Mumbai in the short amount of time we had.&#39;,
   u&#39;The promise of a Swachh Bharat still needs some work to be implemented but the Oberoi is way ahead! It is a wonderful, good smelling, shining environment with lovely staff and good equipment. As we were travelling with our baby, we indulged in the excellent (and also expensive) in-room dining every night. Fantastic food! They brought us napkins with the name of our daughter stitched upon. How sweet was that. A fantastic hotel experience - it was worth it!&#39;,
   u&#39;Everything about our stay was excellent - the service, food (a good choice of restaurants), bedroom &amp; bathroom and pool area. Great location and safe to wander around. I cant fault anything and would definitely recommend it.&#39;,
   u&#39;As one of most legendary hotel in Bombay, everything was well organized. I liked contagious and friendly staffs.\nAlso they have nice restaurants. We tried their Italian restaurant, they served proper Italian cuisine especially I loved their risotto.&#39;,
   u&#39;From the time I arrived until i left I felt very welcome the staff were superb the whole vibe of the hotel is so friendly i can not wait to stay there again.The food was terrific with so many choices, there was not one thing that was not fantastic here.&#39;,
   u&#39;Stayed in Delhi and Mumbai in oct 2017 with my family very good services staff are very helpful and very kind breakfast and dinner was unforgettable.Rooms well appointed,clean and spot on in Mumbai very good sea view. Looking forward to go back in future highly recommended.&#39;,
   u&#39;I have stayed at Oberoi hotels in several other cities. This one is trying hard to please but not yet up to the standard of the others. Staff try hard to serve, but one can see it is a bit forced as though they are being measured on it. In fact they seem a bit stressed. Rooms are small (I had a deluxe room) and cluttered with info pamphlets, brochures and knick knacks. Even the door had 3 thick leather signs hanging from it (do not disturb, make up room, and a third sign I can\u2019t remember) making it awkward to open the door. All this clutter seriously detracted from the peace and comfort of the stay. Bar and food are exorbitantly priced, especially for India - average quality single malt for $20. I like the Oberoi chain, but this one falls short. &#39;,
   u&#34;A regular guest in your hotel as part of BCCI or Star broadcasting crew, I recently visited again during the India Australia cricket series.As always, service was refreshingly awesome, staff was cordial and food was delicious. Your front desk staff is one of the best I have met, and I&#39;m sure you guys have handpicked some of the best people for the job. Also, as special mention, your Gym trainer Aishwary helped me get rid of a nagging lower back pain that was refusing to go since September last week. His specially designed stretching exercises helped me get back to normal in a space of 2 days. He&#39;s truly a savior!!All in all, a truly wonderful experience again!&#34;],

   u&#34;My and my wife&#39;s experience of our stay at the Hotel was excellent. The services were great. The General Manager of the Hotel, Mr. Kermen Lalkaka was most helpful,and kind hearted. Not only did he upgrade to a specious suite, but also saw to it that our 54th Wedding Anniversary was duly celebrated at the Hotel. Amid the Hotel staff, special mention needs to be made of Chelsea Thakur, Guest Relations Officer, who took great care of us through out our stay, and gave us her loving helping hand whenever we needed. She deserves all the Kudos from us. She and Sudha Mehra also joined us for dinner on our wedding anniversary day, and offered us a Happy Anniversary Card, a bouquet of roses, and a cake to cut on the occasion. The three chefs, Mahesh Jadhav, Rohan Narkar, and Umesh Sawant, at the Coffee Shop served us delicious, palatable, and non-spicy dishes of our choice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner during our two nights&#39; stay at the Hotel. Their culinary skills need to be recognized by the Hotel&#34;,
   u&#39;Beginning with a sow check in process their service really picked up over the days I was there. It was immaculate.Their butler service is superb and their rooms were delightful.I had a room facing the city on a high floor and it also got me access to their lounge.The breakfast is a treat with Chef Rajan an institution who wants to feed you very well with instant manoeuvres on the griddle.The hotel is well located in the mid city and good to access the airport and the commercial districts. It has several restaurants of high quality&#39;,
   u&#34;I had stayed recently from 26 - 29 Oct 2017. When I arrived on 26 Oct past 11pm, there were still quite a number of staff attending to guests who have arrived late in the night. Check-in was efficient, and staff attending to me was able to retrieve my booking efficiently, and was also quick to point out that I do not have breakfast and wifi for my booking. He had then cross-sold to me the hotel&#39;s wifi &amp; breakfast bundled package.On my final night on 28 Oct, I had met with Guest Relations Executive Shahszia Khan. She recognized me from my previous stay. I requested her to see if she could grant me an extension of check-out time as my flight on 29 Oct is only at 11pm. Shahzia was quick to offer me an extended check-out time.I greatly appreciate the service. I had managed to have a good rest before heading to the airport to catch my red-eye flight.&#34;,
   u&#34;Living in Malaysia which has no understanding of service what so ever, it was so refreshing coming to India from the customs staff to the taxi drivers, the service and pleasant nature of people was so refreshing.The Hotel is great, in the sort of grand old beautiful style, well looked after and overall a very enjoyable stay. The staff are first class too many to name, everyone is just so pleasant and helpful from the front counter to KK&#39;s restaurant and the Executive LoungeThank you form our first time to India and we will not forget&#34;,
   u&#39;Had the best experience ever. The staff was extremely helpful in making our stay as pleasant as ever. Prajakta went way over and above her required duties to ensure we got all our shopping and sight seeing done. Rooms were cleaned twice daily and the restaurants are amazing. The manager Prateek has done all possible to help and Subodh arranged transportation and tours for us. The pool and gym service exceeded our expectations. You will not regret your stay at this hotel.&#39;,
   u&#39;The entire staff was excellent and made me feel comfortable.Outstanding performance by PRAJAKTA and PRETEEK and SUBODH were very helpful and pleasant at all Times. On arrival they welcome us and removed all our fear of walking on the streets.Out smallest question was pleasantly answered with smiles.All interactions were respectful.&#39;,
   u&#34;Prajakta and preteek and subodh has done a wonderful job in educating me about the hotel and street advise which I appreciate very well. Prajakta is warm and welcoming as we entered the front door and until my visit is over.My stay at the hotel was very worth coming again and definitely will recommend their names and hotel to other people.It&#39;s sad to say I have to leave but I can&#39;t take any of them with me.&#34;,
   u&#39;Hotel has old Colonial decor but with a modern twist.\nRooms are very comfortable and service throughout the hotel is 5 star especially Vishakha\nWe dined in the Indian restaurant which had a varied menu and we enjoyed the lightly spiced food&#39;,
   u&#39;Just some nice words from another happy customer.It was very nice to be warmly welcomed once again by the very friendly staff (ms Mehra even rememberred my last visit a few months ago).

  [u&#39;We had a whistlestop 3 day stay at the Grand Hyatt. Staff were extrememly friendly and professional, the rooms were clean and the food options were perfect. The only downside, and we can live with it, is our room was difficult to navigate to - up to one level then down to another. but it kept us fit.... Definitely recommend and if I could add half rating extra I would. also recommend the Dhiravi slum tour through Reality Tours while you are here.&#39;,
   u&#39;We usually stay at the JWM on Juhu, however a family member was staying at Grand Hyatt Mumbai and convenienced us to cancel and book here, So we did. The Grand Hyatt Mumbai is truly an amasing hotel. From entrance you fell you are in a 5 star luxury hotel. Our initial room was very small for two adults and 2 children (4 and 1), however the staff promptly resolved this and gave a much larger better room.Rooms are generious size and kept to a very high standard. I could not find any fault within the rooms so though to take a wonder around the hotel whilst the wife and kids have a nap. Around the hotel there are many meeting points and rooms, obviously this is popular for businesses. The breakfast menu if 1st class, from English breakfast to Indian breakfast and eggless croissants.You cannot go wrong with the Grant Hyatt Mumbai! Nice pool and awesome staff!&#39;,
   u&#39;I found the carpets shabby and the rooms not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. Took about 2 hours to return passport after check in. Concierge &amp; counter staff are friendly and helpful. Restaurant staff are also courteous &amp; nice.&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed in Grand Hyatt Mumbai along with my family during the Christmas and New year of 2017. One word is &#34;Grand&#34;. We thoroughly enjoyed the huge variety of breakfast buffet. There are two beautiful swimming pools and a huge gym. The interior of the hotel is mesmerizing. &#39;,
   u&#39;Adnan, the young gentleman who welcomed us at Grand Hyatt was too good. Very pleasant and he goes out of his way to give you that little plus which makes all the difference. Great guy and hope he has a long and successful carreer at Hyatt. He is all smile and sweet. If I come back to Hyatt next year, it will cerytainly be mainly because of his care and assistance in ecerything we wanted.Sheela from Mauritius.We are leaving a wonderful friend behind...&#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed in this hotel during a business travel. I think that was the best decision of the trip. I had a super comfy stay, thanks to the very caring and prompt staff, great rooms and service. I also enjoyed dinner at Cellini, their Italian restaurant. I recommend the Tiramisu, it was perfect! Would love to come back for a family trip and stay longer.&#39;,
   u&#34;Everything was amazing!The room was big and clean, the staff was nice and helpful, the food in the restaurants was delicious, specially the chicken biryani at Soma. The pool is very nice.Only thing that was missing was the channels in the tv, there wasn&#39;t enough channels, and few of them didn&#39;t worked.But it&#39;s not so bad..&#34;,
   u&#39;The Grand Hyatt is a welcoming retreat in the hear of the hustle and bustle of Mumbai. The staff are warm and welcoming and go out of their way to assist in anyway they can. I had a problem with the aircon in my room and they did not stop until they had fixed the problem. The range of restaurants and bars is great and provides for any tastes. The rooms are very well appointed with modern amenities. The gym is excellent. The standard WifI is woeful however so pay the extra and upgrade to the premium offering.&#39;,
   u&#34;Absolutely a fantastic stay. It is close to the airport. Check-in was easy and smooth. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. They have a bathtub in the rooms which helps you relax after a busy day at work. A complimentary bowl of fruits was given each day which was so thoughtful. Food was good. You won&#39;t be able to access any other floor other than the one which has your room. Guess its some regulation in India!! Overall a happy experience with hardly any negatives.&#34;,
   u&#39;Hotel was amazing! Staff especially Alex at front office and Najma at the spa were exceptional. Food at the indian restaurant was superb. I would love to go back again! Every little request was dealt with. The staff went above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you for making my family\u2019s stay so memorable. I can\u2019t wait to revisit &#39;],

  [u&#39;No doubt the international chain hotels are a class above the indian owned hotels...We were here just for a night but experienced peace in crowded Bombay city...the rooms nice and comfortable,and spacious unlike the ibis type there was no iron n board in place but was provided quickly.The bath supplies were biotic brand but provided only one set for two pax, specially when one needs to shower more than once a day in Bbay... but on request immediatly provided another set.Window views the Bbay suburbs and the new metro linking the west to east side...the hotel entry is just below the saki naka metro station...once the car gets in and you see the water fountains...you feel refreshed from the chaos n heat outside.The breakfast was grand from Indian to continental...even imported cheese...fresh watermelon juices, the stewards always very pleasant, Elstan took good care of us at breakfast.Was impressed with a notice about the timing rush for breakfast ...Throughly njoid our stay...more so the breakfast... unfortunately some guests are not dressed up ...rush from their beds lest they miss out on b/f.The front desk is not so efficient and may be understaffed, check-in and check-out out is very slow.&#39;,
   u&#34;I originally booked one of the other international hotel chain&#39;s properties near BOM but changed to this one as soon as I realized that I could get 2-way airport transfer with almost the same rate. This made things a lot easier as I did not need to deal with the complications to getting to the hotel for a short transit stay. My flight arrived late but the hotel dispatcher and driver got me to the hotel in no time. It was after midnight but the front desk got me room service in lieu of the dinner buffet. It was just what I needed as it was late. As a IHG P-member, I got an upgraded corner room which was quite big. The decor was mix of modern and local tastes and looked well maintained. Breakfast was good, but I did not remember much as I had to prepare to checkout. The front desk was well trained and showed me currency options before finalizing the paperwork. He then got me the shuttle car to T2 in just minutes. It was pouring when I checked out but I did not get a drop of rain on me before I entered T2. Overall it was a great experience.&#34;,
   u&#39;We travelled from Australia and had a wonderful time! Hotel is excellent, restaurant is out of this world (spoilt for choice delectible spreads on offer that tastes out of this world) , super friendly n helpful staff and they have Niroj who is the best housekeeping staff in the world! Kudos&#39;,
   u&#34;I stayed for 3 nights and it was one of the best hotels I&#39;ve ever visited.The wifi was not working properly but I was not charged more than up to the time I reported that.The breakfast was amazing, and even if i checked in at 10.30 am because of my early flight,my room was ready after 20 mints.Thank you for everything.&#34;,
   u&#34;Very nice and well located hotel with the saki naka metro station just a stone throw away. The staff is friendly and helpful. Break fast platter is great and variety also is great. It&#39;s proximity to the airport also helps as you don&#39;t get stuck in famous Mumbai traffic&#34;,
   u&#34;Overall a wonderful stay. Will definitely visit again if I travel to Mumbai !Positives :1) Check in was a breeze2) Friendly and responsive reception staff. Very welcoming.3) Very efficient one touch service4) Good restaurants and service5) Gym and Tattva spa is excellent 6) New metro station is bang opposite the hotel (2 minutes walk)7) Free wifi and newspaper (for IHG members)Negatives :1) Location outside the hotel /view is not exciting and quite dirty (Not in hotel&#39;s control) 2) Check out queue could have been better handled.3) Steep pick up/drop charges to domestic airport. Suggest to use other alternatives like uber/ola. 4) Swimming pool is pretty small for adults, but good for toddlers/kids. (3ft depth, temperature controlled)&#34;,
   u&#39;&#34;Great ambience, tasty\xa0food, amazing room\xa0service good\xa0rooms\xa0and yummy\xa0food, especially Thai food.Except\xa0biryani, other north Indian\xa0dishes are excellent its at a great location too. Nice place to stay if you need a place near Mumbai airport.&#39;,
   u&#34;Visited mumbai on 28th-29th October 2017, booked this Hotel through booking.com, two mistakes at once. First, the site booking.com is never clear of the true prices, I ended up paying 24% GST beyond the assured LOWEST prices offered \u1e6do me. I&#39;ve been bitten twice by booking.com, first while booking my honeymoon and this was the second instance. I would suggest everyone should be aware of it!!Next the hospitality of HOTEL HOLIDAY INN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT is only to SHOW that they care while they don&#39;t care at all. After we checked in, the bell boy clearly ignored to acknowledge that we had some luggage and May need help with the same, never asked if we needed any help with it. I don&#39;t want to name him here but we came across him thrice and his behaviour was same all the times.Thirdly, the hotel maybe near airport but the location was so crowded that through the window you could directly see the poorly maintained apartments with practically NOTHING else to see. I&#39;ve attached a photograph. The only positive point was the location and that the rooms were clean.  I think anyone should be thinking atleast twice before booking it because there are hotels with better locations anD better value for money. &#34;,
   u&#39;Fantastic welcome at this hotel! We only stayed one night but it was great. Beautiful room with many extras provided for our wedding anniversary - thank you so much. We ate at the buffet restaurant for dinner and everything we had was superb! All staff were friendly and helpful. We had an early morning flight so could not experience breakfast. It was really easy to get to and from the international airport from this hotel. Rooftop pool looked very inviting but we did not have time to use it unfortunately. Well done, Holiday Inn! &#39;,
   u&#39;The vast lobby was very tastefully done, with walls plastered with botanical art, high chandeliers and the warm-toned lighting that adds an extra touch of luxury. We were given a room on the seventh floor, not with great views because this was an airport hotel after all, but with a comfy bed, soft carpeting, TV, writing desk and tea/coffee maker \u2013 all in an earthy colour scheme. Our bathroom was not too bad either. The only thing missing was a balcony. After a refreshing cup of coffee, we set about exploring the hotel.Tattva spa was on the very same floor, while the fitness centre and swimming pool were on the top floor, along with a beautiful rooftop garden. The best part about the fitness centre was the view of Mumbai city with the mountains beyond. Of course, the array of fitness equipment was also impressive. In the evening, we enjoyed treatments at Tattva spa (shirodhara and potli massage). After our treatment, we made it to the rooftop right in time for sunset.We really like the space-saving concept of wall gardens, which has become popular in hotels worldwide. We wandered around admiring the flowers and views in the soothing saffron warmth of the descending sun. Late evening was the best time to take a dip in the glorious infinity pool with sweeping views of the city and mountains and miniature palms on either side.We enjoyed a scrumptious dinner and breakfast at Saptami, the all-day dining restaurant at the lobby. 72, the bar adjacent to the restaurant seemed to have many exciting offers as well.&#39;],

   u&#39;Amazing hotel with the most attentive staff I have seen in a long time. Everything was flawless and I can only recommend this hotel. Especially I was very impressed with the quality of the room and the efforts put in by the staff to make my stay special.&#39;,
   u&#39;We were travelling with a 10 Month baby and they have been so accommodating. They did fresh baby food on demand, warm it round the clock , give us everything we need to be sure that we were confortable with the baby. The swimming pool is great and enjoyable at the end of a busy day. The food delicious and a lot of choices in the buffet. The rooms have everything you will expect from this category.I would definitely recommend the place and will come back! &#39;,
   u&#39;Really good stay here. Staff are amazing. Special thank to Saif and Jigyasa at the reception. They were really helpful and check in was great - upgraded us to a room with a better view. Very clean facility. Breakfast was amazing with lots of variety and vegetarian options. Excellent gym and although we did not get a chance to use pool area it looked really good. &#39;,
   u&#39;The property is old, but the rooms are nicely revamped. Nice. The best part is the legendary service provided to its guests. Somehow, they are able to remember who you are. I am addressed my name (even though I am an ordinary member of the Marriott program). How they do this is beyond me. It goes to show the dedication in their service. At breakfast when dining alone, the service staff frequently comes over to ask how they can assist further. I have never felt so \u2018pampered\u2019 in my life. Indeed the service level is legendary. They are doing everything right at JW Marriott Juhu. Kudos, I will definitely be back here! &#39;,
   u&#39;My daughter and I stayed a week from 22 October and we were so happy that we chose this hotel. The staff are just so wonderful there. Chefs Mr Mehta and Mr Nishad fed us wonderful dishes and were only to eager to please us. Rupesh from Lotus Caf\xe9 served us daily with a smile. Ms Swati made our checkout very easy, efficient and painless. I have to mention Michael from the executive lounge who excelled in customer service. Nothing was difficult for him to handle. He was just exceptional. Thank you. Definitely will return to this hotel.&#39;,
   u&#39;I have been here for team dinner. The infrastructure is good. Great hospitality. Not a place if you are fond of Indian food however you get almost all other type of cuisines. Delicious fruits and deserts add charm to the beautiful ambience&#39;,
   u&#39;I have stayed at this hotel several times on professional trips and those stays were many years back. I remember that even then this hotel was well managed and an excellent place to stay. I stayed in this hotel now after a long gap and that too with my family (though only for one night). It was a delight to find the hotel as good as before! Hotel lobby and surrounding area are exceptional and one feels openness as distinct advantage of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed and many rooms have excellent views of the sea. Service and hospitality in the hotel is remarkable.Lotus Cafe is picturesque with beautiful views. Breakfast is truly a treat. Several varieties, good choice of food items, and personalised service. Restaurant managers, chefs, and sous chef make it a point to meet most guests and engage with them in positive manner. One gets the feeling that they truly care and want to serve with great attention and customised service. Quality of food is very good and this restaurant is a must visit for guests staying in this hotel.Executive Lounge in the hotel is another place that is so well managed. Staff is so attentive and humble that one feels being treated so well. It is well kept lounge and comfortable both for business traveler and guests traveling on leisure trip.Hope the hotel is able to deliver consistent quality in future.&#39;,
   u&#39;We spend a night at The JW Marriott Juhu.... it was amazing... thanks for the service, the kindness, the beautiful Suite. The breakfast was delicious, the location it\u2019s perfect.Highly recommend.Look forward to come back.&#39;],

  [u&#39;After a long trip from south India ,to stay in this hotel on the front of Gate of India becomes dream.Excellent services for all, tasty food, no quantities limits, they upgrade us ,because we use to stay in Taj Hotels, with a four room suite with dedicate buttler, and a lot of other small attentions.Congrats to this management&#39;,
   u&#34;This is my first stay at a Taj property. It was highly recommended to me by a colleague, i was told to make sure that I stay in the palace wing as it is a good mix of Indian hospitality along with a regal experience of staying in a place.I have to admit, the hotel exceeded my expectations in all aspects. I stayed in the sea facing club room at the place. The room was beautiful with antique furniture, it portrayed a perfect balance of modern day living with an ancient touch of class. A special thanks to Devia who was there at the entrance to greet us. She took us straight to the room , it was my first time when i didn&#39;t have to check in at the desk, devia sent our passports to the desk while she escorted us to the room. she was very polite and extremely helpful. She made the perfect start for us. The second thing that really stood out was the amazing concierge team (dinesh, and his team) helped me arrange for a motor bike so that i could ride around mumbai and relive my old memories of the city. i have never experienced a concierge go so much out of there way in order to make the guests comfortable. i was speechless. they were professional and super polite and helpful in all aspects. amazing team. We also dined at masala craft , they had the navratari thali special going on. the food was scrumptious and Nishant at the restaurant was really helpful and knowledgeable about the food. he helped us select and the food. At breakfast you are greeted by your name and taken to the table you like. The chef went out his way and made us samosas and poha which were originally not on the menu but in order for us to enjoy our breakfast to the fullest , he went out of his way . Really heartwarming service. Overall the palace side of the property (where we stayed) was amazing. The staff goes out of their way and the hotel is mesmerising. We also tried the spa which was excellent. A really good weekend away from work. Service at Taj Mahal Palace has now got me excited about all their other properties. I know it will be tough for the other properties to match this level of service but i am sure they will surprise me once again.&#34;,
   u&#39;And enjoyable stay. The room was immaculately kept. We really enjoyed the luxuary of Ploh Bath robes . The pool was a lovely temperature and the staff, including the changing room staff were very good.We enjoyed the afternoon teas and evening drinks, made available to club members.  The cleaning and floor staff on fifth floor were excellent. They were very polite to customers, even standing aside to let customers pass, a very nice touch. Breakfasts were excellent, there was a good range of different food types to suit all pallets. The pastries and cakes were beautiful. The lady who greeted us in the morning remembered our room number (Madonna) and was very warm and welcoming. Similarly, the gentleman who served us tea at the left hand side of the room (looking out of the windows) was very helpful too. A window seat in the same room was very enjoyable. However, the music was very repetitive. Rather like water torture, please change the records every day! We felt that that was a lack of staff coordination, command and control, when serving drinks food et cetera. On two or three occasions we did not get what we asked for and had to re-order. We thought that a more assertive maitre d\u2019 type person leading the staff may be beneficial to the hotel and guests to make sure that food and drink is delivered to customers promptly. We found that that was too much artificial sent in the lobby and palace lounge, I found it rather nauseating and overpowering; less scent please. It would have been rather nice if we could have plugged in our Apple TV or other HDMI cable to watch our own programs, but this facility appears to have been disabled Overall, we had a lovely stay and would like to return again one day.If you\u2019re looking to book this hotel, think about joining the Taj club scheme which is free.&#39;,
   u&#39;The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai...From check in to check out ... it\u2019s a totally different experience all together. Great History &amp; Great Culture. Every part &amp; corner of this property is a master piece to enjoy &amp; admire. It\u2019s a Museum or an Art Gallery with a huge collection of Paintings, Old Photographs, Old Artifacts. Unmatchable Hospitality &amp; House keeping. Here everything works perfect. Staying in Old Heritage wing ( club floor ) facing Arabian sea is an ultimate indulgence.&#39;,
   u&#39;This hotel is generally very good. However if you choose to stay in the tower wing and not the (more expensive) Palace wing, then you will be treated like 2nd class citizens. There was no welcoming feel and the breakfast area for us tower residents was cramped. We chose the tower wing because we preferred the modern feel, NOT because of the cost - so Taj management, please take note.&#39;,
   u&#39;I was there for a conference over the weekend. Scenic view of the sea from my room. Great service. Knowledgable and welcoming front desk staff.. Truly vintage feel. Extravagant rooms and food was awesome!&#39;,
   u&#34;We decided to experience Taj hospitality at their flagship hotel - The Taj Mahal Palace and took a red eye flight to Mumbai. Hotel staff was very accommodating as they allowed us to check in early. We were also given an upgrade to the Palace wing which was the most beautiful part of the hotel. The location of this iconic property is very impressive and the facilities are top notch. Staff is very helpful. Even though we stayed for a night, our room was freshened up at least 4 times which is not seen at any other hotel. Due to the upgrade, we had access to the lounge which is the most expensive room in the hotel due to presence of 2 gaitonde paintings and tastefully done flooring and panelling. Health club and pool is top class and so is the pool deck area where evenings can be spent enjoying the ambience and barbeque. Amazing experience and can&#39;t wait to return again.&#34;,
   u&#39;The reviews for this hotel are amazingly positive. Is this collective admiration really deserved? A-b-s-o-l-u-t-e-l-y.There is no need to further discuss the absolute beauty of this hotel, inside and outside. The Taj Mahal Palace is certainly among the top 3 hotels we have visited in more than 50 countries around the world. What really struck us during our 3-day stay is the customer service level. They could simply rely on their reputation and tourists would keep coming into the Taj no matter what. Instead they will do amazing things to push your satisfaction to new levels: personalised check-in with hotel history, calling you by your family name at the restaurant on the second day (I just don\u2019t know how they did it), remembering how you or your wife prefer certain meals, sharing advices, tips and recommendations (where to shop and what to pay), offering complementary Indian desert, delivering top hotel car service to the airport and the list goes on and on.They certainly do not take your business for granted and I admire them for that given their leadership position in the Mumbai market. The service culture in this hotel is impeccable. Thanks to the staff (with a most special note to Beauty at the Shamania restaurant) for a most amazing stay at the Taj Mahal Palace!&#39;,
   u&#39;This property is little old but maintained well. Their ambiance is authentic and classic so you can just feel their history and legend even you can enjoy staying for a while in their lobby. Staffs are well trained, friendly and proper distance. It was god experience to stay this hotel.&#39;,
   u&#39;We are lucky to have styed her befor a couple of years ago, but what can i say?! still perfection.The Palacee wing is amazing and being welcomed with red roses by the wondrrful manager Ramneet Singh was very special :) Cant wait to come back again!&#39;],

  [u&#39;Great hostel with private room. Located very close train station, bars and tourist attractions. Check in was one of the friendliest and most straight forward I had in India. Room was immaculate. Incredibly clean and the cleanest room I stayed in whilst travelling. Shower was basic but straightforward and got the job done. Staff offered a personal tour of Mumbai which was a nice touch. Has a rooftop common area but I didn\u2019t see anyone else up there. &#39;,
   u&#39;I stayed for 2 nights here back in October 2012. The rooms were ok, very basic and suitable for backpackers which is what I expected so nothing to complain about here. However, just to warn you not to pre-book any bus or train travel connecting in another city with these guys as I paid them to get on a bus from Delhi to Agra. The bus never turned up in the stated location in Delhi so I was left stranded in the dark morning hours and in the end, I had to hire a cab to Agra! &#39;,
   u&#39;I only slept one night in this hostel but i would definitely recommend it! It is a basic hostel and I paid 700 rupees for a night in a mixed dorm. Breakfast was not included. Good wifi connection, even in my room. Location is perfect. It was closeby/ walking distance to the trainstation, markets/ bazaars, the musea and the gateway of India. It was safe to walk alone in the evening (even as single woman). The people were friendly, i was allowed to leave my luggage behind during the day, as I had an evening flight. I could even take a shower in the afternoon (after my check out). Good option to go to this hostel! &#39;,
   u&#34;This is THE place to stay at!I have never experienced a hotel with staff caring so much about their guests. They provide their guests with anything you ask for and answer any questions you have. They have tours around the city, I did the slum tour and it was an insighful and amazing experience. The staff make you feel more than welcome. The manager and his wife also working at the hotel even invited me to their house for a dinner. That&#39;s how friendly they are!!!!Top three:- Wifi! Fast and never lost its connection.- Location! The location is THE BEST. South Mumbai, but not in the crazy chaotic streets. It&#39;s calm, nice and safe. And walking distance to tourist attractions such as the gateway of india. - The room! The room is big, fresh (for being india) and really really nice! Don&#39;t miss out! Book your stay at Travellers Inn!&#34;,
   u&#39;Conveniently located in Fort area.. very near to CST in case you have to catch a train from there.. it is the best place to stay.. lots of options for food nearby. taxis are easily available. Rooms and bathroom ar basic but clean. Staff is good. Mohit is very friendly and helpful. Had a great day stay there before catching our train to Aurangabad.&#39;,
   u&#39;Clean, convenient, friendly staff. Above all value for money.\nAdmidst the city. Gateway of India, Colaba market, fashion street... all are nearby.\nMarine drive just 10 mins away.\nTotal VFM. Very economical. Owners are too good.&#39;,
   u&#39;This was my third stay at Traveller\xb4s, for so many good reasons. The rooms are fairly priced for Mumbai, comfortingly clean and quiet (things we learned not to take for granted in hotels in India!). The location is exccellent, with the Gateway, Colaba and Churchgate within walking distance, and a great array of restaurants and shops nearby. All staff are well-mannered and professional.However, what gives Traveller\xb4s that precious extra value is no doubt THE SERVICE. It is easy to underestimate how tricky or time-consuming getting things done can be in Mumbai if you don\xb4t know HOW. Especially for those new to India, anything from finding a working ATM, to changing money, to getting your phone repaired or choosing a place to eat or a worthwhile tour can become a frustrating half-day wander. Managers Mohit and Neal helped us out with all this and so much more, and were happy to share their knowledge and listen to our problems. The welcoming spirit with which they do so is touching, as we discovered when Mohit invited us over to his home for the Hindu celebration of Sri Ganesh darshan (Sri Ganesh festival, end of August). Things can go quite wrong in India, and when they do it\xb4s the quality of service that makes all the difference. We were at Traveller\xb4s during the devastating rains that flooded and blocked all of Mumbai at the end of August. Mohit and Neal were constantly at hand, updating us and trying to help us find a way to get to the airport for our flight out, going well beyond the call of duty as we had checked out hours before. I suspect it is this mix of hard work, know-how and genuine care that has made them one of the most sought-after hostel options in Mumbai, and they well deserve it. Give them a try, I would be surprised if you were disappointed.&#39;,
   u&#39;1. Tryng very hard to contact them to change eaarlier booking. No results. 2. Came there as agreed in the morning. they wanted me to wait till afternoon to get the room in a empty hotel. 3. Zero contact with recepcionist. 4.As I claim bad reception they were pretending that it must be another restaurant in Bombaj no0t they. Hotel in Hinglish mean restaurant not hotel. Althogh I love this cultoral differenties never will go back to travellers Inn.&#39;,
   u&#34;Very nice clean place to stay, situated in the old city centre, 10 minutes walk from the gates of India) We were happy to stay there, were surprised by the quality-good prices for Mumbai. Stuff was very nice! The owner, Mohed, as well as other crew, very very hospital, it was a pleasure to stay in this hotel. The rooms vere very clean, with hot water, soap, TV etc. The roof top is cousy- with sofa&#39;s, tables and a boiler with filtered water.&#34;,
   u&#39;A basic hotel but they have everything what we needed. It is centrally located, the room was clean and comfortable and the staff was really friendly and helpful, so they just make us feel like at home.&#39;],

  [u&#39;Amazing ambience, excellent service amazing food a MUST visit .commandable service by Valerian, Lincoln and his team.all the very best for new restaurant .very nice lobby and bar.... Feel like home sweet home...&#39;,
   u&#34;The Hotel is located at one of the quietest locations in Mumbai (Near Aksa beach), a rare Resort to find indeed!Some of the best features of the Hotel are:a) Pool is clean and bigb) Great Food, including a large variety of food during breakfast (which is free!)c) Rooms are super clean, big and poshd) Garden area is a great way to stroll during early morning/late nighte) Property is well lit through out the nightf) A 24x7 Cafe is available which offers some great food as wellg) Spa is available (never tried though)Basically, you would be basking in the comfort of the Resort and would instantly fall in love with the place.Please don&#39;t miss to have a short break at The Resort, if you are tired of your mundane work life!&#34;,
   u&#39;It was a great experience at The Resort and will be back soon.. Thank you hospitality team for making our stay so memorable and comfortable. Must say the property is beautifully maintained and the staff is very courteous. If you are planning to go for a family outing this will be the best resort to visit.&#39;,
   u&#34;A perfect place for relaxation. Good food and services. Their sea view rooms have beautiful balcony sit-outs overlooking the pool as well as the Arabian sea, luxurious bath tub in the suite, and huge comfortable beds. Their truly de-stressing spa creates a tempting plan for a relaxed weekend that&#39;s not away from the city. Their courteous and polite staff helped me set up a nice pre-birthday surprise for my sister.&#34;,
   u&#39;It has an awesome ambience with the best service and the food is also relishing....the interior is classy and elegant and has an amazing pool side restaurant...commendable work by Valerian and other staff...had an amazing time...&#39;,
   u&#34;Excellent Ambience. Very good rooms facing the beach. Excellent food. Staff is very polite and courteous. A very nice place to spend a day. Having a repeat value. Mr Valerian Restaurant Manager is very helpful and courteous. Very spacious restaurant..new buffet counter...excellently renovated...lots of counter with multiple cuisine... we have revisited after 9month&#39;s as it was under rennovation....just loved it...&#34;,
   u&#39;The resort is a resort that has come to our rescue every time we are bored to plan a weekend. The resort is right in the city but as it is in a little interiors it gives you a holiday feel. As it is a very old resort now the interiors look a little old. But they have good swimming pool. A small outdoor play area for kids. And it is on the beach. They also offer a good brunch package where you do not need to be staying there but you can pay just for brunch and using their swimming and other facilities. It is a good option where you can spend an entire day with lot of fun. The rooms are also decent in case you wish to stay&#39;,
   u&#39;we visited during Diwali days, it was an excellent holiday. being busy at the counter we were given check in really fast, sea and pool facing room. Breakfast spread was very good and food was also tasty. we found alacarte to be little overpriced. overall a very nice holiday. Charisma gave me a good deal and the staff and service were good.thanks.&#39;,
   u&#39;I had first visited The Resort 4 years ago with my husband after we had been newly married. The idea to visit again was to relive those memories but alas it was nothing like the first visit. The property is not at all maintained properly. The gardens are unkempt. The services were way way poor than what we had initially got. The price charged no where justified the service we received. Dinner at the restaurant was such a poor experience. The buffet was Rs 1400 per person but there was no one to attend to us. They were clearly short staffed. No one to clean tables or give cutlery. Many tables were just lying dirty without any one bothering to clear it. The buffet food was cold and the starter was served after 20 mins. We had to ask for everything, right from the cutlery to water and not once but 3-4 times. All this pain and we paid Rs 1400 for this. The breakfast was nothing sort of a food court. Since they did not have enough seating arrangement, people were standing and eating where ever they could find space. The total experience was so surreal, nothing close to the serenity or peace we were hoping to find. On check out time, we were called 4 times asking to check out though he had informed the first that we would be checking out at 11am. Between 10am to 11 am they called us 4 times, it felt as if they were asking us to leave immediately. All this pathetic experience at room tariff of Rs 7240. Would leave it up to you travellers to decide whether you want to shell out this kind of money for this kind of experience.&#39;,
   u&#34;Unless you can&#39;t stretch your budget, this may be a place for a getaway, else the standard of management is poor. First, we had to request for change of room by the evening, as the drilling and carpentry work in the vicinity didn&#39;t stop. No concern for the guests staying. The quality of food is just average, including the breakfast. The breakfast on Sunday was another disappointment, there was a huge crowd maybe due to the weekend. It was task getting a table, getting hold of cutlery was another fight. The noise in the restaurant was beyond constant comfort and the quality of food again being very average. The plus points are the location, the big size swimming pool and the view of the sea from the property. &#34;],

  [u&#39;Rahul Oak and Rahul deshpande are organisers and extremely rude. Never ever go to this place. Rooms are shabby. When asked for a bowl during lunch it was denied. When asked for a tyre for a kid in pool it was asked to pay Rs 200. When asked for a bat it was asked to pay Rs 500 as deposit. No drinking bottle was also provided.&#39;,
   u&#39;An average place. Add to that foul smell of fishes from nearby beach and your thoughts of relaxing get ruined. Maybe I am biased because I am a vegetarian. I did find some people enjoying the sea food to their heart here!&#39;,
   u&#34;Pali Beach Resort is my all-time favourite.The rates as compared is more economical and it assures the best services. The food is okay. There are two types of pool. The smaller one needs a little maintenance but the larger pool is awesome! It is little deep however, the beginners can enjoy at the start as it is not that deep. Some of the waterslides are not functional but who cares! All you need to do just dance and dance on the music as there&#39;s a DJ! Deluxe and Senior Deluxe are very nice and cozy. The washroom might need little maintenance. The standard rooms are also okay, for a better experience of the ambiance, try senior deluxe! The staffs are very very helpful right from the reception to the housekeeping. It is and will be one of my favourite resort all time!&#34;,
   u&#39;Best place for couples to visit. The food provided by the hotel was awesome as well as it was delivered on time, no delay in delivering food or any other thing. If you are wishing to go with your family, friends or your loved ones then feel free to visit Pali Beach Resort. A place which i can recommend to many&#39;,
   u&#34;Worst experience....it as my baby&#39;s first birthday... They charged for everything but nothing was good as expected... Dogs nd cats were roaming here and there... Even though spending such a huge amount got bad comments from family members... Lights were dim... Photography was done thru their own lights.. Worst experience we ever had...sab bol bachchan hai. &#34;,
   u&#39;Excellent place to enjoy the butter chicken and Dal Makhni with assorted breads.The service quick .The taste is authentic .The decor is like a old haveli .Perfect place to spend a quite evening with family.&#39;,
   u&#39;Good reception.. still remember the courtesy shown by Uncle at the gate.. wonderful place to visit along with family &amp; friends. Good swimming pool &amp; quality rooms fitting the budget. Varity of Food options&#39;,
   u&#39;Most friendly and helpful receptionist ever, so lovely and great first impression of resort. We had excellent service in both bar and restaurant where we had our breakfast and lunch .The restaurant\u2019s menu was great and will satisfy most taste-buds!  lovely ambience of the resort. Food is too good as well as service. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Greenery in the resort is amazing. Employees were very courteous I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future. Thanks again to all the staff -&#39;,

   u&#39;Great Location in terms of proximity to the NESCO/Mumbai Exhibition Centre, Goregaon.The upcoming Fly Over project which is still incomplete causes heavy Traffic Jams. Great Team &amp; Good F &amp; B Facilities. The Fitness Centre needs a revamp. Good Value for money.&#39;,
